1	I unfortunately gave them the benefit of the doubt and booked with them again in September .
1	I used it few times and often they was dirty , driver was slpooy and cars are old and no comfortable.
1	I used this company as I thought it had good reviews , little did I know what I was getting into .
1	I waited 20 minutes for the tour bus outside my hostel ( the location I had indicated at time of booking ) .
1	I waited over 40 minutes on the top for the return ride , and we did not receive any information how long we should wait .
1	I wanted to book a transfer from the Airport Innsbruck to Mayrhofen for my friend and me , in case of that we both was looking in the internet for a transfer for us my friend who was in the uk told me the price to mayrhofen it was showing to him more expensive than to me at the same time we was phon.
1	I was disappointed that we did not learn all that much during the tour .
1	I was horrified at their customer service .
1	I was not offered a reschedule or even my money back .
1	I was presented with two options : 1 ) take the new fare or 2 ) cancel the booking .
1	I was really disappointed that the agency scheduled the trip without consulting the weather forecast , but above all by the fact that they left the whole group under a thunder for more than three hours .
1	I was shocked with how long it took the get there as it only took 3 hours to get home .
1	I was still confused why it was higher and a day later received another email titled URGENT asking if I was happy to accept the new amount of 113 EURO .
1	I was told I could not go back up without paying the full fare .
1	I was told the driver was not coming and we were going to have to sort it out ourselves .
1	I were among the first 50 in the queue but after waiting for 1.5 hours I still found myself lining up waiting for the mini vans .
1	I will certainly not use this company again and will certainly not be recommending them to anyone else .
1	I will most certainly be telling friends and colleagues not to use it but rather get a bit of exercise and walk up Srd .
1	i will never enter that kind of cable car again .
1	I will never use this company again .
1	I will say no more .
1	I wonder why the company didn ’ t contact me to inform me that we had to wait a bit ?
1	I wonder why the company waited nearly 1 hour to inform me , and when they did , they told me that he was 15 minutes delayed , and not half an hour ?
1	I would be extremely cautious .
1	I would certainly not recommend this company .
1	I would definitely not be using this company again and would not recommend .
1	I would have cancelled if it was not for the fact that the transfer was about 12 hours away and there was no way of organising a different one .
1	I would never again book with Select Dubrovnik as they do not have the tourists ' best interest in mind .
1	I would never use them again , I never want to feel as helpless as that day and can not trust they will stick to their word regardless of when you book or how much you pay .
1	I would not do this over that 's for sure .
1	I would not trust this company as they are very unreliable and do not take the safety of their passengers seriously .
1	I would say skip the cable cars .
1	I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE SIRS BECAUSE THE FEELING OF BEING IMPOSTORS WE WILL NEVER FORGET .
1	If he was there , he should have contacted the hotel staff about our whereabouts .
1	If I had not have phoned , 8 people would have been left at Corfu airport .
1	If that ’ s true it is very risky to go in their cars .
1	If they owe money , admit it and will not pay , then it is theft .
1	If this is how they treat potential new customers I can not believe there is still a business to run !
1	If we were to go back we definitely wouldn ’ t bother with this again .
1	If you are really desperate to go to the top ( where there is very little to see anyway apart from a good view , an exorbitant cafe and shop , and a museum about the war ) then do it, otherwise , ughhh give it a miss.
1	If you decide to visit Montenegro , it is quite beautiful , but I would think twice before taking this tour , this guide , or Magical Tours .
1	If you do not want to get ripped-off again though you will have to stand behind other tourists cramming to get pictures next to a gigantic cross .
1	If you have an adequate fitness level you can walk up and down to avoid the cost .
1	If you have mobility issues , especially a wheelchair , do not waste your money .
1	If you only have 2-3 hours for the inner city , do not risk loosing time with the cable car .
1	If you travel in high season there might be long queues at the bottom station of the cable car .
1	If you want to spend a tenner to travel for a few minutes up to an overpriced dusty dump on a hill then this is for you .
1	If not perhaps Conecto should not accept the booking or the money .
1	IF YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PEACE , DO NOT CONTACT THEM .
1	Important , please avoid my disheartening experience and possibly others , with the company Connect to Transfer , I booked a return trip on11th Dec 2017 from Hannover Airport to Bielefeld , on the 10th December KLM cancelled my return flight , immediately I called Croatia ( Connect to Transfer ) can...
1	In 2015 drivers seem to have been replaced by non-locals who can not speak the language but more interestingly,do not know the area and routes .
1	In Kator , we were teamed up with a lousy tour guide girl who did not mention anything more than we already knew from the bus and it left us with no tie to explore the city and walking up to the chapel on the hill - the bus guide misinformed us telling us we would have enough time .
1	In other places even if there were uncontrollable " technical problems " the operator would have sent buses to take their stranded customers down the hill but this operator showed no consideration whatsoever for the people they stranded .
1	In summary , please be aware that any legitimate changes you wish to make to your journey may lead to the loss of your deposit .
1	In the end I had to call a different company to rush us to the airport and pay again even though I had paid a deposit to Connecto .
1	in the end we decided to wait in a bar and we didn ’ t even see the waterfalls
1	In the winter departure time is not 16 : 00 PM , it is 15 : 30 !
1	In addition , I lost my passport in the post office in Mostar , what they did is to leave me in an unknown small town and ask you to do everything by yourself .
1	In addition she never bothered to let anyone know where restrooms were , or places for drinks / snacks / atm ’ s at rest stops .
1	In case you decide to ever go and try the Dubrovnik Cable Car be sure to check and over check the latest timetable so you do not end up like us walking for 1 hour in complete darkness on a small road full of stones and gravel .
1	In order to avoid booking those big coach tour which usually takes 2-3 hrs at Montenegro border control , I even sent a message to SelectDubrovnik to double confirm that I am booking the correct tour - the 18persons minibus tour .
1	Inside , it is dark due to heavy tinted windows and can be claustrophobic as the vehicle is filled to capacity .
1	Instead of aplogising , the compnay tried to use our card again .
1	It ’ s a mid evil city with a wall on the coast .
1	It did not look like he was trying to pass a car as we did not accelerate and we nearly went head on into an oncoming car .
1	It has been 30 working days since the incident and despite continuous e-mails , I have still not received the money and now they are not responding to my e-mails .
1	It is a danger break so that we could not use the buggy furthermore .
1	It is a row of four seats cramped next to each other , where only two seats are free for my friend and I. 
1	It is a tool simply to fleece the cruise ship passengers who spend a few hours in the city .
1	It is bad for Croatia to treat visitors like this .
1	It is badly run and expensive for what it is .
1	It is even inhumane , if it was happening in my city I would definitely find / direct an alternative , and pay the excess amount , and never let my customers down early morning , before dawn .
1	It is less than 3 minute ride and it is the most expensive cable car I have ever used
1	It is neither ethical nor responsible .
1	it is not my problem , find the path yourself , he is in charge of the cable car .
1	It is not a good ride as it is very short .
1	It is quite unprofessional and very bed experience .
1	It is the second time that this company leaves us stranded without our contracted service .
1	It lasted a few minutes and when it was over I wish I had not walked all the way up to the cable cars ( it 's quite a long walk ) .
1	It looked so different and I was expecting the cable car to take us all around the city however it really was a disappointment .
1	It looks like you can walk down a few hundred stairs and be back in Old Town , but that 's not the case .
1	It opens at 9 am , we got there 8.50 and there was already a long queue standing in the already baking sun .
1	It 's a LONG car ride and if you are prone to car sickness like I am , you might have a tough time on the windy roads .
1	It 's a very small ride and the cars are extremely crowded / suffocating .
1	It 's simply not worth the price .
1	It 's tight , people smell and you will not be able to see nothing anyways as they pack it to the brim .
1	It seems the groups off the cruise ships are given a priority .
1	It was a mistake !
1	It was also a 4 hour drive and was never offered to stop or any conversation for that matter .
1	It was an absolute harsh mistake , totally regretful about having done this .
1	It was late in the dark at nearly 7pm and 200 + people were stuck uphill in the dark lining in queue for hours to wait for some mini vans that could only take 6-7 persons each ride to take us down hill .
1	It was mediocre , service was below standards and we were left with 20 mins of running to the budva city and back ... did we take the tour to explore Montenegro or eat ?
1	It was not as expected and we were disappointed .
1	It was scary .
1	It was way too hot and boring to recommend anyone to see .
1	its a 2 minute ride that costs 30 euros for 2 people back and forth , offers nothing amazing view wise , and its a bad photo op since the cables are in the way all the time .
1	JUST stay away from SelectDubrovnik if u dont want your vacation ruined .
1	Lastly company instead of helping us to compensate for the amount we paid is also not willing to refund the initial amount which was being charged to us , which shows clear intention of cheating clients by taking money in advance and not giving them services
1	Later in budva , she ' recommended ' a restaurant that she said was fast and best of town - WRONG !
1	Let down is an understatement .
1	Lift in the upper building is not working or permanently occupied by staff so you are limited to the arrival level .
1	at just under £18 per person for a return trip lasting approx no more than 3 minutes each way it is nothing short of daylight robbery .
1	More of an opportunity to take a picture from the top of the walls and ocean but , you can do this as you are leaving Dubrovnik as well .
1	Most of the other tour guests were also suddenly told they would not be dropped off at the Pile Gate and were instead left at the cable car stop .
1	Much too pricey for two of us leta alone if you have children with you .
1	My advice is not to use them because it seems one could allege that there is a lack of integrity within their business .
1	My husband instantly blocked his card .
1	My parents took a view and said it not for them .
1	My review is based on next facts : - wife bought for whole family ( 4 pax ) as a surprise tour over the Viator for 182 $ ( around 160 EUR ) while later we found out that same package is sold on their website for 120 EUR - this is not old FORD car , this is cheap replica that every second of the tour.
1	My seatbelt was not working properly and this was the same for my husband and the lady sat next to me .
1	My wife was very upset and doubt whether we were discriminated as we are Asian .
1	name of driver was Michael, I would not reccommend this transfer agency .
1	Needed to get a taxi from city centre to Panarama Restaurant and as cable car not working we needed to get a taxi .
1	Needless to say , our day was canceled .
1	Needless to say due to the fact we were not given ANY prior notice our transfer was not turning up we missed our flight and had to wait 6 HOURS at the airport for the next flight .
1	Never again will choose Connecto because the do not connecto .
1	Never arrived .
1	No , I said , I have messages to prove it .
1	No driver at Geneva airport .
1	No family tickets .
1	No further contact was received from them .
1	No one said anything , climbed up hill past closed ticket office .
1	No thank you .
1	No thanks .
1	No tour guide .
1	No vehicle turned up .
1	No one said it was closed !
1	Nobody called back .
1	Nor were we told that we would not be stopping for lunch until 3pm !
1	Not much to see on top .
1	Not only would I suggest you do not ever use these companies but I will be taking the matter further to determine whether their behavior is fraudulent .
1	Not to mention , once we got onto this HUGE bus ( instead of luxury van ) , the bus was TOO large to even fit in the street of our villa so we had to WALK .
1	Not very customer friendly .
1	Not worth €20 return though for the cart .
1	Not worth it .
1	Not worth money as only on 3 minutes and the que was 45 mins long .
1	Not worth spending the money , in my view .
1	Not worth waiting for forty minutes while the operator takes her break and then calls you stupid for giving her the wrong paper .
1	Nothing much up there .
1	Nothing to see from the top but red brick roof top houses .
1	Nothing was said in the reviews about how hot mostar actually is .
1	On argument the driver threatened us to take us to police .
1	On leaving the restaurant a taxi was called for us , for this journey we were only charged 150 Kuna ’ s half of what we were charged by Dino - if you don ’ t want to be conned avoid this taxi driver at all cost .
1	On our visit we were told that the queue would only take 20 minutes , but people at the front told us they were waiting more than an hour .
1	On return journey the operator unexpectedly advised passengers they could not take the return journey and should either walk down or take a taxi .
1	A horror story .
1	On the first leg , the driver was 40 minutes late meeting us at Geneva Airport .
1	On the return leg , the driver did not show up at the agreed time .
1	On the return transfer the driver was not able to install the car seat and got it stuck half in .
1	On the way back , she was slow to answer any questions or concerns because she was too busy reclining on the front seat and reading her book .
1	On the way back they were over 2 hours late and did not provide a suitable car seat for my 3 year old son .
1	On the way home our Guide and Busdriver had a long , loud and annoying conversation .
1	On top there is a civil war museum that was small and not very interesting .
1	Once 30 minutes late and the other just never showed up .
1	the cable car is so crowded you can ’ t breath .
1	Once you ’ re up there , you can ’ t get good pictures as the cable car pylons rare in the way .
1	Once you are up there you will have nowhere to sit apart from at their own restaurant .
1	Once you go up its even a worse line to go down .
1	Only 2 cars and they were overcrowded .
1	Only if you are a photo freak you should spend so much to make a 3m up and down ride, the distance covered os too short and nothing special to offer !
1	Only on checking with our back we realised the full money was not refunded and only on then asking the company they started mentioning cancellation charges !
1	Operator was very rude and incosiderate to how the passengers would return back to the start point .
1	Our car was not as we booked - we had booked a luxury catagory and we got sent a tiny Renault .
1	Our driver did not provide any info during the trip at all .
1	Our driver was awful, and the driving was unacceptable .
1	Our driver was Russian , spoke NO English or French , not one word .
1	Our guide , Marinara , was not engaging with the group ( such as inviting questions or asking what our interests were ) .
1	Our of curiosity I went online to get another quote and was still quoted the original 92 EURO .
1	Our rental car company fitted our seat properly without me asking so I do not think it is unreasonable .
1	Over in a jiffy packed in like sardines .
1	Overall , I feel like I barely saw or learned anything today and was mostly just in a hurry to make the most of my limited time .
1	Overall , If you want to take a tour with a boring guide holding a history lesson , than this tour 100 % suit you .
1	Overall good reviews but my advice is if you need a taxi , hire a car instead .
1	Overall very stressful and inferior service - I certainly would NOT use them again and would NOT recommend !
1	Pathetic drivers and services .
1	Paying 570kuna ( 85Usd ) for a return trip is just not worth it .
1	Pick up 40 minutes late on both outward and return journeys .
1	Pick up from the apartment ( which had been booked at the same time as airport pick up ) was also late , again I had to cross the road and walk to the aforementioned bakery where the driver was sat on his phone .
1	Please avoid this company they are unreliable , unprofessional and more importantly dangerous .
1	Please do not do this trip if you are elderly , pregnant or have small children as the amount of time spent on the bus is ridiculous and whilst the falls and Mostar are nice ... you would be better hiring a car and doing this tour at your own pace .
1	Please DO NOT use this company .
1	Please think twice before booking with this company , Connecto Transfers .
1	Preordered minivan driver arrived 45 minutes late .
1	Pretty much a scam for me though , only a restaurant on top of the hill .
1	Put simply the cost of the cable car left a sour taste and spoilt the whole experience .
1	Queue jumping is basically encouraged and groups given priority over those who have been waiting for 15-30 mins .
1	Quite expensive , and although the view was good from the top it seems like a bit of a rip off .
1	Unfortunately he was 40 minutes late .
1	Really hiking prices to cash in on Game of Thrones and Cruise Ships
1	Really think carefully before booking these types of tours .
1	Refund promised , but what are the chances ?
1	Rip off
1	Ruined our day and stay in Split .
1	Save your moeny .
1	save your money and spend it on something else
1	Save yourself stress , time and ALOT of cash and book with someone else .
1	Secondly they are not transparent with their cancellation charges .
1	Seriously this is an overrated place .
1	Shame on you guys at connecto-taxi .
1	Shame you n you Conecto
1	She didn ’ t give anyone her phone number , and her instructions on where to meet or what we were doing were unclear at best .
1	She has not requested other people to change seats .
1	She is horrible, like a history teacher to repeat the information that you can find on the internet .
1	She just repeated " u wait for the next coach " and drove away ( again the " you are none of my business " attitude ) , leaving me and my wife on the road shocked and didnt know what to do .
1	She kept complaining about how much work she had to do to get us through the border .
1	She looked worried and panicked for most of the trip .
1	She rudely told us " you want to go with us or not , if not go and get the refund " , I chose to have my refund because the price and itinerary of the big coach n minibus tours are completely different , and I didnt want to compromise given their rude n careless attitude .
1	She says that , as we took a tour on the same bus the day before and we already knew we would be seated at the back , we should have said something earlier .
1	She says this would not be possible .
1	She then raised her voice and asked me to take my seat , noting that I am just one unhappy customer .
1	She was not pleasant .
1	She was probably getting commission for the guests , so she could not care less about what we saw and visited .
1	Simply appalling .
1	Simply because an incompetent cable car attendant decided it is more intelligent not to make a public announcement that this is the last trip going down .
1	Since then they have refused to return my deposit , although 17 hours notice was given , and no costs were incurred as a result , furthermore I forwarded KLM 's cancellation notification , but to no avail .
1	Skip this line skip this city .
1	Skip this place
1	SKIP the Cable Car & Rent a Car or hire a Taxi !
1	So , 5 stars for the view from the top , but I am afraid only 1 star for the greedy money making management .
1	So I asked her for the company address for refund and she wasnt even sure whether her company has offices in the old city !
1	So not a great experience and would obviously think twice about booking with this company again .
1	So we departed some 25min later than planned .
1	So we left - disappointed !
1	So we paid extremely high price for three taxi .
1	SO BEWARE   IF YOU BOOK ONLINE AND THEY CANCEL THE CABLE CARS YOU WILL NOT GET ANY KIND OF REFUND ONE VERY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED COUPLE
1	Some nice views but not worth the cost .
1	the path is very dangerous and takes two hours .
1	Spend your money on other attractions
1	Stay away and use another company is my advice .
1	STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY unless all you want is a ride to the top of the mountain and back .
1	Still , no attempt to compensate , negotiate or discount from their ridiculous quote of 213 which was more than it would have cost to book 4 individual taxis !
1	Still nobody showed so we called the office twice once ourselves and once by our hotel .
1	Such an inefficient service !
1	Surely when a transfer is pre booked and the drop off address is given to the company the customer can expect to be dropped at least at a convenient place for the customer .
1	Terrible behaviour avoid this company .
1	it would be scary ! 
1	Thankfully the journey was only about 4 minutes but it was one of the most horrible , smelly , disgusting 4 minutes of my life .
1	That is really shameful , as we have to buy a new buggy .
1	That said , whilst we were in the City the organisation and communication from the people that run the cable car was astonishingly poor .
1	 i just can give 1 star !
1	The “ luxury minivan ” is a small vehicle that can accommodate up to 21 adults , including the driver and your guide .
1	The 2 ladies at bottom of the cable car ( where you purchase your tickets ) were extremely rude to us because it seems we could not read the sign that it was closed ) .
1	The activity cost a lot but was not worth the price .
1	The additional cost and delays to our vacation have been stressful .
1	The air conditioning on the mini bus only works when the bus is moving so this was a very long and warm wait .
1	The attitude of the cable car staff was " technical problem , not our problem " and made no attempt to assist those that were stranded .
1	The attraction is kind of overpriced , and you can drive up here for free .
1	The bus picked us up on time and the driving overall was uneventful , but the a / c had some sort of issue and I was either sweating profusely or freezing for the entire journey .
1	The cable and cars did not look stable enough to ride on .
1	The cable car costs $37.00 Canadian for a couple of minutes .
1	The cable car is a 150k round trip with long queues and incompetent staff .
1	The cable car is currently not working due to ' force majeure ' contract disagreements .
1	The cable car is like a sardine box , it 's totally not worth the money or the 30 min wait to go up .
1	The cable car is too packed to really make the most of the view up or down .
1	The cable care ride is very short , you need to wait in a long line to get in , it runs in 2 cars , each can take up to 30 people so inside the car you can be crowded actually by people .
1	The call centre is in Croatia and is staffed exclusively by extremely rude agents with poor English , who will argue with you and not bother apologising for messing up your holiday .
1	The company cancelled my Val D'isere to Geneva Airport transfer with < 2hrs notice , said they could pick me up an hour late which ( with Easter Monday ski resort traffic ) would likely make me miss my flight .
1	The company offered no solution or alternative .
1	The couple in front of us asked the sullen " gatekeeper " why hordes were allowed through when we had been queuing for an hour her answer was " they are a group " !
1	The drive from town to Dubrovnik airport was disaster .
1	The driver arrived after half an hour .
1	the driver basically would stop at various places and tell us " 15 minutes " - we were left to our own devices in trying to figure out what we were to look at .
1	The driver did not show for this despite us paying the deposit .
1	The driver did not show up to collect us , despite having confirmation emails the day before , and we were left stranded .
1	The driver got to the hotel 1 hour late .
1	The driver kept saying it was the parent 's responsibility in croatia for the seat and then proceeded to try to fit the seat incorrectly before I stepped in .
1	The driver phoned the apartment for instructions and was told to take us to Pile gate but he decided not to because the traffic had been bad and he would be late for his next pick up .
1	The driver showed up 11:30 , and he told me that he had informed the company around 10 o'clock that he would be half an hour delayed , and that he asked them to inform me .
1	The driver spoke little English and never gave us any sort of narration .
1	The driver took us on a route driving quickly on a motor way and the safety of my child was put at risk .
1	the driver was also late in collecting us and we only made our ferry transfer by the skin of our teeth .
1	The driver was late for pickup , which ok , can happen but then 20 minutes late for our return to the airport - no contact made about any delay .
1	The Dubrovnik Cable car is a huge waste of money and better viewpoints can be seen renting a car ( which is also more cost effective if you are traveling a group ) .
1	The evening before the transfer ( which was early in the morning ) I get a call from their customer service saying they made a mistake when calculating the fare , and it is actually 160 EUR ( 50EUR more ) .
1	The first was in Berlin in 2017 and I withdrew my complaint and my complaint for the company 's apology and its offer to compensate for their incompetence .
1	The GORAN I SPOKE WITH SAYS HES DOESNT HAVE A MANAGER HE ’ S JUST CUSTOMER SERVICE apparently he can ’ t answer questions because his dispatcher is waving at him .
1	The guide from the minibus picked up two other tourists then wanted to leave immediately , without even looking at us .
1	The interior of the car was stinking after cold cigarette smoke and driver was chasing like there is no tomorrow .
1	The intial amount was refunded but the waiting charges weremt .
1	The issues were as follows : - Purchased tour clearly says “ minibus ” and “ 18 persons is the maximum for this tour ”  but everything was false.
1	The lady at the ticket booth did not warn me that the route back would be so dangerous .
1	The line for the tram to get up and again down we ’ re horrible the Sunday sunset we were there .
1	The male running the cable car said he had phoned to the restaurant and shop but nothing had been handed in which I thought unlikely as the waiter would have seen them as he was heading to clear the table when we were leaving .
1	The manager is very rude and has no customer service .
1	The money was taken in CASH upfront and little did we know what we were getting ourselves into .
1	The most annoying part is there is no contact from the company at all .
1	The office were extremely unprofessional , refusing to talk to us on the phone , and would not come to any agreement on their mistake , leaving us backed into a corner with the driver , holding us in the car on the side of a motorway and having to pay double the initial cost only so we did not miss ...
1	The only reason we didn ’ t miss our flight was due to a flight delay .
1	The only thing up the top other then the view is a massive mobile phone mast and a exhibition you have to pay extra to go into .
1	The only way down is via a VERY BUSY , VERY DARK STREET , where there is no shoulder or sidewalk to walk on and the cars are going VERY FAST .
1	The operator staff need some training in customer service before would consider this again .
1	The people waiting to come down again have to queue up in the hallway where all foot traffic is so there is a jam of people trying to move in 3 different directions at once .
1	The people who book here taxis and maybe somewhere else the prices ar unfurtunately different anyway !
1	Magical Tours and our Tour Guide were abysmal .
1	The price is shocking and they make it impossible to use other good value public transport to see the miseum we badly wanted to see at the top .
1	The problem is there isn ’ t much to see on top after you spend the 150 kuna , at least definitely not worth spending the money .
1	The queues for this ride were too long .
1	The receipt does not reveal the price with clarity ( maybe for fiscal pr shared money in our presence .
1	The reserved money is no longer reserved it ’ s charged to my account and I have a bank statement to prove it .
1	The ride itself only lasts a few minutes and you have better views from the top than from the car .
1	The ride lasted minutes , and the high winds at the top were so high we dived into the shop where the prices were too high to even consider buying a memento of the trip .
1	The ride lasts less than 5 minutes and it is way too expensive .
1	The ride took so long cause out of the 18 people on the bus 2 of the passengers had paid for a trip to mostar and medjugorje they had said this at the start of the trip but were taken anyway .
1	The ride was totally stressful and waste of 220 euros we spent for a 3 hour ride !
1	The road had neither pavements or crossings at this point , so we had to run the risk of crossing the road with our suitcases .
1	The roundtrip ticket was $25 , which was kinda pricy .
1	The same morning of our transfer , only 2 hours before departure , we received a call telling us “ the car is not fit for the journey ” and that it would not show up .
1	The scenery and the photo you can take just isn ’ t worth the money .
1	The service was 10min late although the driver did try to advise of the delay about 20min before citing traffic .
1	The sign at the cable car entrance stated that the operators had not complied with payments and regulations .
1	The skyline is extremely short and the cable cars were crammed with tourists on the day we attempted to use it ; and we are SO glad that we were deterred by the crowds !
1	The staff are rude .
1	The staff was were very very rude and refused to budge , spoke in high tone in take or leave it .
1	The staff zoned off the exit and prioritized a bus load of other tourists .
1	The taxi driver on the leg back was 40 minutes late , did not apologise and blamed the traffic .
1	The taxi we 'd booked , FAILED TO ARRIVE !
1	The ticket is very expensive .
1	The title and description of this excursion are not true what so ever .
1	The tour was rushed and hurried all along and times were cut short .
1	The trip itself lasted 2 minutes where I saw virtually nothing due to the amount of people in the car itself .
1	The truth is : they have overbooked in the minibus tour as they said the minibus was full and therefore put me into the another big coach tour !
1	The cable car itself isn ’ t worth it .
1	The view point from the cable car building is poor and obstucted by the cable cars and cables .
1	The views are almost the same with next to no wait , besides oncoming traffic in the one-lane road to the hill .
1	The facilities are rubbish .
1	The views of Dubrovnik are amazing , however , not quite worth the price your asked to pay for .
1	The views of the city , which many reviewrs are talking about , you can get the same and beautiful pictures from the road .
1	The whole thing was a big stressful mess and to not have a driver that even understood the first word of English , knew where his passengers wanted to go or knew how to get there was against everything this company advertises for on its website .
1	The woman that served us was the rudest nastiest person we have encountered on this trip .
1	The woman was rude and accused me of being mistaken and said I changed the time .
1	Their booking system simply chaotic and their staff are unprofessional !
1	Their customer service is abhorrent and they clearly cash in on the notion that we are transient .
1	Their excuses did not make up for the fact that they had left us stranded with clock ticking on a flight .
1	Then back on bus and taken to derelict factory by a weir , where we had 10mins , before going to viewpoint over suspension bridge before returning to cruise ship .
1	Then received an email , 45 minutes after our arranged pick up time to say someone could be there at 14:30 .
1	Then the driver dropped us off outside a bakery and said your apartment is he somewhere .
1	Then they refused to refund as they said changes were not permitted , so we had to claim via credit card company .
1	Then told system regularly makes mistake despite confirmation of the fee and pick up ; either pay a higher fee or go elsewhere and they will charge you more .
1	There are also remains of a fortress but it 's not attractive .
1	There are only two cars and each one arrives about every 9 mins .
1	There are plenty of other things to do in the area with equally beautiful views .
1	There are some amazing things to do in Dubrovnik and this is not one of them sadly !
1	There is a museum there , but it is not included in your trip price .
1	There is no discount and you will not be able to see anything other than from the main platform .
1	There is no information on what you can see as you would normally expect from a sightseeing attraction .
1	The service team were not honest .
1	There seems to have been no thought into the queuing system to come back down , we queued for 30 minutes , snaking down the stairs with people pushing in .
1	There was a long , long queue , which is not a problem in itself , but very frustrating when you have spent an hour in both the sun and rain and as you get closer to the front , tens of dozens are allowed to jump the queue .
1	There was a mix up with our collection point meaning that we were collected 30 minutes late .
1	There was a sign to say closed due to storm - but it had well passed !
1	There was also an overpriced restaurant , which we did not bother to visit because there was yet another queue .
1	There was confusion in the crowd .
2	$17 for a 3 minute cable car ride is ridiculous .
2	140 kunas or about £18 to get to ride in a cramped space with 30 other people to get to the top of a hill pretty much sums it up .
2	2 cars on the line means that long waits ( over an hour ) are possible and there is absolutely no shelter from that merciless sun whilst queuing .
2	About 20 + people were squished into a hot sweaty cable car which took a short ride to the top .
2	Add that the trip is not 2h45min as they claim , but 3h30min - each way !
2	Advice - if you have an grumpy unfriendly tour guide , block their behaviour out as best as you can and enjoy the sights for what it is !
2	After 30 minutes found ourself coming in to another port ( was not informed that we will be picking up other passengers beforehand ) we had a long wait for passport control to come round even though we were still in the same country , and astonishing amount of passengers to board , some with luggage...
2	After a 4 hour trip home on choppy seas we then had to wait 30mins to get off after the Catamaran had docked as yet the staff felt it best to unload the baggage first , not very customer friendly after the journey , in the heat and with many passengers in a rust to get back for dinner .
2	After a while we noticed that there were problems with the ship  boat engine .
2	After being picked up , our skipper told us that there was a miss understanding even though we called a day before to check the meeting point .
2	After some discussion , they gave us a number to call for a taxi .
2	Again no mention of sea conditions to forewarn everyone to expect a bumpy ride .
2	Again we fortunately had assistance from the apartment owner who sorted this out for us pick up back to airport was late due to " stuck in traffic " however this seems bad planning as Split seems to consistently have a lot of traffic Finally neither vehicles we used had any taxi markings which was a...
2	Along with a bunch of other people , we waited in line for 30-45 minutes .
2	Also if you are late by 2mins , your tour guide may scold you for lateness as ours did !
2	Also it takes 10mins to walk from the waterfalls to the bus at the top of the hill once you factor other tour groups and people at the site .
2	Although not pressured into buying the extras the reality of prices in Venice ( not provided by the company ) were over exaggerated .
2	And it was for a distace of 30km - they did not have to take that ride and back !
2	And the cable car is really expensive !
2	And the cable cars are packed with tourists clicking away , well , it was peak season .
2	And we did not think that the views from the top or the ride itself justified the amount of money they are charging .
2	Arrived within 20 minutes and we were back in the Old Town in no time .
2	As an example when it came to transport around the city they did not even mention the vaporettos or the 24 hour tickets you can get for 20Euros ( there is a stop right next to the ferry port ) .
2	As the trip started , he was using his phone about 90 % of the time which left us feeling a bit unappreciated .
2	As this has been described as a must do experience , we chose to spend the money but we are all disappointed .
2	As we were the second couple in the queue managed to get a place at the front of the car on the ascent and must say the view and ride are spectacular , however the car was absolutely packed , we were like sardines and as I found on the descent it was impossible to see anything apart from the body ne...
2	At around 18 quid this is just too much to ask .
2	At first , we have been left at the meeting point to wait for about 20 minutes which was quite unpleasant as the outside temperature was high .
2	At the top , the views are stunning , however take a cab , bus or Uber and enjoy the views just the same .
2	Avoid it unless you are desperate for photos .
2	Beautiful views but was like being in an oven , no air conditioning so I did not really enjoy it .
2	But it is impossible to get a decent photo without the cable , rocks , railings or poles in the way .
2	But that was not really the cable car peoples fault .
2	But there is no chance of that .
2	But we were wrong .
2	By the time you get to the lower station you might as well continue the walk up .
2	By the way , there is a staircase nearby , so you get on top faster than the funicular .
2	Cable Car was not too exciting .
2	Certainly , weather did not seem to be the issue .
2	Coach and tour parties are frequent visitors and can swell the queue markedly .
2	Conclusion : Do not take this ferry trip .
2	Considering that the price is about 10 euros we were expecting more than it Just being a transportation means .
2	Couldn ’ t get on either time as was nowhere near the front .
2	Crasy ques , long wait times worth doing though just to get the views and photos of the area .
2	Definitely one to avoid during the heat of the day .
2	Despite the very rough weather , many green faces and a lot of confusion we were not given any reassurance by the staff until 2 hours into the trip .
2	Did not even manage to get on cable cAr as the queues were just mad ! !
2	Disappointed .
2	Disappointing .
2	Do it if you have to but apart from the great views there is very little at the top
2	Do not waste your money take a taxi to a hilltop instead Also the operators look like the Croatian mafia and look very unpleasant
2	Do not waste your time in the " museum " .
2	Do some research beforehand , go on a private gondola and expect to have a choppy journey so take some sea sickness tablets if you are affected !
2	During this hour of waiting without any shade , two women fainted , this did not prompt the staff to start the boarding process as they loaded bags first .
2	Entrance to Italy was more efficient than the warnings given by guide . we booked gondolas as reccommended by the guide and venezian line , would not have done this if we knew that gondolas were easy to get and that gondola prices were fixed eur 80 , - basicly at a lower cost than offered by venezia...
2	Even though they new nothing about what was going on .
2	Everybody on board got up very early and could really use a nice nap on the way - but was forced to hear this pitches in three languages .
2	Few days later they charged me the whole amount .
2	For a family of 6,this was extremely expensive at 170kn per adult and 60kn per child ( 3&3 ) there really should be a family ticket available , , ...
2	For example we were informed the walk from the port to the city centre would take an hour minimum and therefore strongly advised to pay extra for a taxi with the company , the walk in actual fact took no longer that 30mins .
2	From the moment we are on route the company start ' selling ' a map and a pen with a contact number in case of an emergency - €5 .
2	Going up a little more challenging that of course going down .
2	Had to wait for the next car as first one was full but wait was not long ( May so pre-season )
2	Handy for those who can not do the walk but money is a lot .
2	Have seen better views .
2	Having visited Dubrovnik a few times , the cable car was still on our to do list , however this visit we had time , what a disappointment , although we were lucky enough to not have to queue , there were a lot of people on the viewing platform which greatly restricted the photo opportunities .
2	He texted me back that he would be at least 30 more minutes before he could get there .
2	He was rude , threatening , and gave them a real fright .
2	hello my name is joao , i came with a group of 50 persona and in the first day dindt work , we were all inside and just stop working , 2 day after we come back and we could go , unfortunately the service is not the best but ia a good view .
2	However , even with the reduce number of visitors , the cable cars are still very packed .
2	However , for approximately 90 minutes on the way to Venice and 30 minutes on the way back , the crew kidnapped us and forced us to hear lengthy sales pitches , intended to sell the Venezia Lines tours , Gondola boats , lunch , guided tours , postcards , calendars and what have you .
2	However , we got off the ferry at the port and no driver .
2	However at €32.40 for two adult return tickets ( approx . 8mins total travel time ) the cable car is ridiculously overpriced .
2	However for the price of an aerial view of the city , we could have had a darn-good meal somewhere , and for this alone , we felt fleeced .
2	I am terrified of heights so was practically forced in to this trip !
2	I believe Connecto was aware of the travel update in Croatia and they could of phoned me way before pick up time so we can prepare ourselves better or picked us up early in the morning .
2	I called the driver and he had no idea he was supposed to pick us up .
2	I cant recommend this , it takes a coupleof minutes to get up , look down on Dubrovnik and then get back in and go back down , rather expensive .
2	I did text the driver back that we were going to get a taxi .
2	I find this very rude and bordering with unfair business practice .
2	I give this a two because of the poor service we received at the top .
2	I give Venezia some points for the email and the ticket refund but I suspect that , being early in the season , they did not have enough passengers so cancelled the trip .
2	I pity those who were gullible enough to sign for such tours .
2	I thought they will charge me only the deposit amount ( the only amount I give them the authorisation to charge my credit card ) .
2	I understand managing a large group of tourists can be difficult however there are better ways of getting the outcome you want without being abrasive and cold first thing in the morning .
2	I was booked to travel from Venice to Porec in May but received an email the prior day stating they would not be sailing .
2	I was disappointed .
2	I was very upset .
2	I would not allow my family to take this trip .
2	I would not class this as a must do .
2	I would not repeat or recommend .
2	I would not suggest this is a ' must do ' experience - definitely not for families with younger children - due to the over priced tickets and the whol...
2	I would say that if you are short of time do not bother you are not missing anything , especially for the price .
2	If possible , I recommend to get there by car and save the money for the restaurant up there ...
2	If the tour program allows for more time at the waterfalls then this would be better otherwise you are essentially paying 23kuna admission for a short period of time with very little time to swim and change and be back on the bus .
2	If we had not already purchased the tickets we 'd have definitely hopped in a taxi which would have been both cheaper and quicker .
2	If you can spend the little extra , go sit VIP .
2	If you do not fancy the long walk up there you can get a cab for much less .
2	If you do this tour which includes the waterfalls , do not bother swimming .
2	If you like aerial views - ok - but I think its a lot of money and £10 for a small beer and a bitter lemon at a stand-up bar was not welcome
2	If you suffer from claustrophobia I would not recommend this ride , I do not but still found it very uncomfortable .
2	If you wanted a guided tour in the neighbourhood of the Piazza San Marco , you had to pay extra , ... You can easily walk to the city centre .
2	In result of this we paid another cab man 2400 Kuna to drive to Split ( giving every last penny we had ) The apartment assistant Andre was kindly trying to help us and called his friend for this cab , we ended up missing our flight , totally unhappy I appreciate there was other people In this positi...
2	In which case it was an hour of my life I can not get back ,
2	Incidentally it is expensive in St Marc 's square but as soon as you get off the beaten track you can find lots of places that are good value .
2	Instead they just ripped us off and took our money .
2	Instead use it for its intended use which is to get you from Point A to Point B in a faster time that it would take to walk around .
2	It 's slow and expensive .
2	It 's super expensive for a gondola ride .
2	It barely goes any distance .
2	It costs less than $1 so it is not expensive or anything , but I would not specifically seek it out if you were looking for things to do in Zagreb .
2	It has put us off using this service next year for Croatia .
2	It is a RIP OFF .
2	It is a very short ride and quite expensive . 150 kn .
2	It is bit expensive also .
2	It is hard to take pictures , because of the cable car lines and machinery being strung across your view .
2	It is not worth money they charge .
2	It is simply a mode of transport to get from the upper town to the lower town and takes less than 60 seconds to do the entire thing .
2	It was a pleasant two minute ascend but not worth the price .
2	It was an extra cost and stress not needed .
2	It was closed and - it was hyped a bit in tourist guides which made us make the effort to go there but we were not disappointed that we could not get on it .
2	It was expensive but we thought a nice cold drink at the top with beautiful views together with a nose around the war exhibit would make it worthwhile...
2	Je kunt gemakkelijk te voet gaan van aanlegplaats
2	Just a restaurant with limited vegetarian options and a souvenir store .
2	Keep it in your pocket and walk the stairs which is right next to the funicular !
2	Long queues to buy tickets .
2	Long wait in the sun for another crammed ride back down .
2	Massive queues at times .
2	Moral to the story , Venezia lines are good to get from A-B but do not believe any of their sales pitches , or their scare tactics if you have never been to Venice .
2	Mother nature can not be controlled but better planning can !
2	My grandmother ( did I mention she is 85 ) had a stash of dollars that she show the manager he grabbed the money from her hands and yelled at them then threw some change back at them .
2	My husband and I coughed up £12 each to go up in it , unaware that the Dubrovnik city card we later bought would actually get you on for free ( at no point were we told this by staff or sign ) .
2	My mom had spent her cash and only had a credit card and the Venezia Lines " manger " would not let her on the boat .
2	My mom tried to catch the last taxi from Venezia lines .
2	My partner and I went on this day tour today and found the conduct of our tour guide to be rude and combatative from the beginning of our trip .
2	My top tips if you want to go up : 1 .
2	Nevermind , we gave it .
2	Nice view of the city but expensive and not worth the effort do the walls instead this is just a waste of time It is your standard tourist trap
2	No clear directions to where to get on .
2	No explanation .
2	No idea how much it was or if it was worth it .
2	No one has contacted me as of today
2	No warning of rough seas in advance and many passengers were sick and frightened by the uncomfortable nature of the trip .
2	Not a pleasant experience on a hot day . luckily the ride only lasts 3 minutes .
2	Not good for 4 adults and 2 kids and a lot of bags .
2	Not impressed and feel we wasted 160 euros on not very much at all .
2	Not particularly good views on the way up and a concrete plinth with a cafe and gift shop at top .
2	Not the best experience we booked online assuming all taxi firms to and from Split airport would be about the same standard .
2	Not worth £100 per couple .....
2	Not worth the $60 round trip for two people .
2	Not worth the money at all .
2	Nothing at the top except the view and a very expensive restaurant which is fully booked !
2	Old city prices , but you do not have to pay to enter the old city !
2	On our way back we were told that we will not stop to swim  snorkle or any other activity due to the engine failiure , which left my girlfriend disappointed as she was looking forward to that the most .
2	On the way back it was not made clear where to pick up the boat .
2	On the way back the cabin was unbearably hot , the sea was very choppy and there was a lot of people feeling sea sick .
2	Once I have to cancel my flight because my son got sick , and as it was late I sent them an emil for cancellation .
2	Once on board we were told the journey would take 3 hours , not 2 as previously informed .
2	optimistic time schedule by venezian line , arrived Marcos square at approx 1240 hours .
2	Our tour guide started off by announcing the rules of the trip eg " no talking whilst I am talking " , and " I demand respect ... " .
2	Our tour guide was obsessed with time management instead of warmth and engaging .
2	Overall , we thought this was expensive for what it was
2	Overall we thought that they were trying to get in on the " ripping people off " that they suggested happened across Venice .
2	Overpriced and have to wait for ages to actually get into the carts .
2	Passenger comfort and peace of mind do not seem very high on the Agenda .
2	Perhaps if our tour guide tried being warm , friendly and engaging with the group this would have lead to a better day .
2	Poor value and hard to find and not worth the effort !
2	Probably to do if never took a cable car in your life , or if you want to share a small room with a lot of rude chinese or korean tourist
2	Really expensive .
2	Return trip would you believe was worse than the outward trip .
2	Rough seas on way over , Ferry felt like it was in a power boat boat race .
2	Safe the money and do the city wall walk .
2	Sailing Croatia left me and my girlfriend a bit unsatisfied .
2	Save your money .
2	Save your money for a boat trip ! !
2	Short ride and not really high up .
2	Should have some sort of ticketing in force as when I was there it was 37 degrees and you just could not stand for that long in the heat people 
2	So , we wished we had skipped this as it took us about 2.5 hours for the whole cable car experience , and we do not think it was worth the time .
2	So be warned and have a plan B.
2	So we had to switch for a much smaller boat driven by two young people who drove far too fast regarding the high of the tides and the size of the boat .
2	Split Airport from what we could evaluate the public transport was non existent .
2	Still waiting for refund .
2	Super long lines to use this cable car and it 's really not worth the money or effort .
2	That ruined the night , especially when dinner was for my partners 30th birthday .
2	The bar rips you off , there is a price list , but they will just add some to the price . chairs are very uncomfortable , and there are not enough toilets .
2	the boat trip was not so very organized . no reserved seats so our family of 3 was scattered throughout the boat . not much visible through the windows , the fogged up fast . you cant see out front , so the entrance into venice is lost . they try to sell you tours in venice , so be prepared to get s...
2	The cable car is expensive , crammed and ultimately unnecessary .
2	The cable car is expensive and the journey up nothing special .
2	The cable car is ok but overrated .
2	The cable car itself is large , standing only and filled to the brim , this affords passengers with little chance to enjoy the view or experience
2	The Cable Car itself is not such a special experience at all .
2	The cable car ride is not more than 2 mins long and It felt like we were in a heard of cattle , as it often does in places over-run with tourists .
2	The cables continuously get in the way of any picture you want to take of the old town of Dubrovnik
2	The cafe / restaurant at the top is way overpriced and if you are just getting a drink they make you sit in the back corner .
2	The cars carry about 20 people so if you are unlucky to be at the wrong end I imagine your view is quite limited anyway .
2	The cola was flat and the water was warm and the food was served on dirty plates .
2	The cost at nearly £11 each person is not worth it .
2	The day we were there we had queues of 30 minutes plus both ways .
2	The journey to Venice from Porec was not the most pleasant due to everyone feeling quite sea sick although we understand this is uncontrollable to a degree !
2	The manager Ivan who I was talking to , I found to be very course on the phone , at times he would speak over you and kept stating his driver has been at the bridge for hours .
2	The mountain top can stand a modest bar - with perhaps that rare thing in Dubrovnik a beer at a decent price .
2	The place is crowded in summer so changing rooms are busy and there is a lot of people around .
2	The restaurant looked good but not as quaint or authentic as in the old town .
2	The return trip was very rough ( we later found out due to the tornado that hit that evening ) .
2	The space at the top is small with most of it being taken up by a restaurant .
2	The staff we walking around looking petrified and handing out sick bags .
2	The stairs are cumbersome but this is so short and pricey for its value that I can not recommend it .
2	The stress of finally reaching Split Airport after 9pm and having to purchase a brand new flight to go home on 17/07/2016 .
2	The thing that did really annoy us was that we were going to the top for a dinner booking at 2115 , therefore we took the car up close to that time ( not knowing that in May the last ride back down is at 2100 ) .
2	The told them that he would leave them in Venice if they could not get cash .
2	The transfer back was just as bad as on the way there .
2	The transfers to the boat from Venice were not included by Venezia Lines , this was not made clear at the on set of the trip .
2	The trip took a minute or less and it was so crowded that we could not see anything from where we stood .
2	The view definitely wasnt worth the money we paid to get up there .
2	The view was lovely but once you ’ re at the top there isn ’ t much to do unless you want to sit down for an overpriced lunch .
2	The view was ruined by the cables of the car .
2	The view would be great , we went up at night time but had loud tourists in there with us taking flash camera pictures of their children so we could not actually see anything .
2	The views are better from the city walls .
2	The views are pretty spectacular but are marred by the fact that inside you are seething about how much you just spent to take a few " breath taking " photos with other sweaty tourists in the background ( it 's very cramped up there ) .
2	The views from the 3 minute ride are not as good as you get from the top .
2	The views once up are nice however jam packed with tourists . 15 minutes is enough to see what you paid $50 - $60 for 2 people .
2	The views were lovely but I still think it was expensive for what it was .
2	The voyage was a disaster with many people ( not us ) getting sea sick in both directions .
2	The water taxi back to the ship was ok , again not much communication from the tour guides when at the meeting point but it got us back to the ship and that was that .
2	The way there was long and a bit boring since we did not really socialize as a group .
2	Their was no commitment for anyone to pay for a tour but the information about Venice was essentially a sales pitch to buy their tour .
2	There are huge queues & when you get to the top the view is great but that 's it & then huge queue to get bank down again .
2	There are poor stray dogs at the top that no one seems to want to help or even comment on if you ask about them .
2	There is a amphitheatre but when we visited it was not really active
2	There is a great deal to do in Dubrovnik .
2	There is a restaurant at the top but it is unsurprisingly very expensive .
2	There is one small bar at arrival , but is expensive and you can just sit and look the cloud ( I was unlucky that day ... ) .
2	There is the option of walking up and down the hiking path to the top ( takes about 1 hour ) but I do not advise this in the heat of the day - we saw some very dangerously dehydrated people !
2	There nothing else once you get up to the top .
2	There was a problem with one of the engines or one of the Hulls as I was watching the engineers ( regularly checked by the captain ) in out with pumps and hoses .
2	There was no order of how this was done , apart from splitting in to 6 - we were in a 6 with other people who could not speak English and although we were first at the queue , did not get a choice of where we sat during our ride .
2	There was nothing to do at the top .
2	There was ZERO communication from the guides and once they had finished their feast , they got up and walked off without a word ; leaving us to chase them frantically to try and find our way .
2	There were 3 options on one plate : inedible lasagne , spaghetti Bolognese with no Bolognese and hard pesto pasta .
2	There were numerous problems along the trip .
2	These guys are jerks .
2	They also charged 27Euro per person to go on a gondola suggesting that the price could be much higher however around the city gondola 's are clearly listed as 80Euros for half hour for a max of 6 people .
2	They company makes a joke about having the best cappuccino in the Adriatic and they should ... just over €4 for what can only be described as espresso sized coffee !
2	They informed us the sea was choppy ( which everyone knew ) and that the trip would take longer than the planned time , we were not told how much longer .
2	They played on peoples insecurity of not having been on the city .
2	They sold us a return ticket just before it closed ( we thought it closed at midnight ) without any notification that we wouldnt be able to use it .
2	They still charged the set amount even though they dropped us 1.5km from the place we had agreed .
2	They went to Venice and everything went well and until they were on the went back .
2	They were very negative about not purchasing their tour elements .
2	They were waiting for us but outside the airport terminal so took a while to find Did not ring our apartment owner as requested on a number of occasions which meant some confusion when we arrived in Split old town .
2	They would not sell us tickets and would not allow us to get on and buy tickets at the bottom .
2	This cable car tour is far too expensive for what is offered .
2	This is a great thing to do sadly overpriced .
2	This is definitelly a bad design and we would not recommend it until they build a proper terrace embrassing the magic view ! !
2	This is not really a tourist attraction .
2	This is the same rule when taking any form of transport ; bus , train or ferry - no organized lines and queue jumpers for everything everywhere , especially the locals that know the system .
2	This looked like a great way to get to upper town but unfortunately it is under construction , so you will have to use stairs .
2	This seems to be a common tactic so , if going to Trogir , first ensure that they will take you to your destination and do not pay until they have done so .
2	This tour is not worth the price .
2	This unfortunately was not our experience and suggest you are very clear on instructions etc if you do decide to use this firm .
2	This very very bumpy ride completely destroyed our backs and it still hurts almost a week after .
2	This was a disappointment .
2	This was not a language issue since my mom speaks English , Italian , Spanish
2	Thoroughly disappointed .
2	Thought it strange that no mention of any issues and we were only told we would be arriving late after we had missed our arrival time .
2	Thus they are busy and expensive .
2	Tips : the entrance to the blue cave is not included in the price ( 50 HKR more for each person ) , and the interest of the last island is limited .
2	Too many people crammed into the cable car so could not see the view and it was very warm .
2	Tour guides were rude to us and when it came to disembarking we were asked to wait for all the day trippers to get off the boat first .
2	Tried contacting on last day to be clear on pickup point but with no luck .
2	Two stars for responding to my emails after hours and decent pricing .
2	Unfortunately this event was not all it was made out to be .
2	Unless you have issues walking or have a physical impairment , there is no reason to take the funicular .
2	Up on the top was fully packed with tourist like us , and there is not a proper space to queue ... It 's not worth its price in my opinion .
2	Us Yorkshire folk do not like being ripped off .
2	Very disappointed .
2	Very disappointed . .
2	Very expensive and disappointing .
2	Very expensive with nothing to do once at the top .
2	Very long queues at the entrance during sunset tine .
2	Very short .
2	View is not much better then the roadside and trip is very short .
2	Views obstructed by cables ,
2	WARNING - there is no queuing order and zero manners from tired travellers , it 's a battle of the bravest , beat off your opponents when cabs do actually turn up ( one every 3 mins or so to service 50 + people ) Cab drivers do not care who they take .
2	We also objected to the way that tour guides on board provided information about Venice .
2	We arrived at the port at on time the catamaran was not there , it finally arrived at about 7:45 we did not start boarding until at least 8:10 .
2	We asked for a refund to the price of a one way ticket but was refused .
2	We booked online for the blue & green caves excursion with Dino and his 12-seats boat , but the day of the excursion , Dino told us that we were too few for his boat ( 4 people ) and he could not make profit .
2	We booked this trip from Rovinj a couple of weeks ago through our travel rep. Set sail around 7am , the cabin was freezing and no option to put any heating on .
2	We bought in Venice for lower than their price and were given and hour ride around all the main sights .
2	We came here during the " off-peak " seasons , still we spent more time queuing for the rides ( up and down ) than enjoying the view , which probably ...
2	We did not mind that so much as things like that can happen .
2	We did the Old Town Wall walk then the day after took the cable car and was disappointed as the views are not as good .
2	We ended up spending only about 20 minutes up there as there is nothing else to do and I would only recommend if you a ) have the Dubrovnik city card or b ) like throwing money away .
2	We ended up waiting in the taxi line and paid 43 euros instead of 30 had we gotten the transfer and lost about an hour .
2	We eventually arrived in Venice at 10.30am , the full trip we were sold numerous trips for the day , all wh in were very expensive .
2	We got in the car and then found out that it could only be a one way only and we would have to catch a taxi back after dinner .
2	We got to Porec on the day planned but I could easily have been standing on the dock with no hotel in Venice and a paid hotel room empty in Porec .
2	We had never been to Venice before so was interested in listening to some of the stories being told however these all linked to their ' extras ' no-one was being forced in to taking these ' extras ' however it felt like if you did not take the extras you would have a very expensive day in Venice .
2	We had to wait for everyone and their bikes to disembark , go through passport control before setting sail about 40 minutes later .
2	We reached the harbour where the hovercraft was waiting , it took c40 minutes to go through security and then we were ushered in to a boiling hot cabin with no aircon again .
2	We set off and then the drivers diverted to a parking place outside of Trogir as they did not want to enter Trogir and get caught in the traffic .
2	We spent a further €80 for a private gondola ride , with was longer and took you round the most beautiful parts of Venice .
2	We spent about 15 mins looking at the view and then left ... so again , not worth the money !
2	We then came out of our tuna can to see the four tour guides enjoying a very civilised meal of pizza , chocolate cake and drinks galore outside in the lovely sunshine .
2	We then had 3.5 hours " free time " to walk around , get lunch and get back to the terminal for another security check .
2	We then went for lunch .......... The lunch was awful .
2	We took a ride down with this cable car and we were very disappointed .
2	We took the cable ride as a part of a shore excurtion from our ship . well the view is nice but the cable car is cramped with people and when you get up there you find out that except from some view there is nothing else to do . at least we did not wait a lot of time in line like other 's did
2	We turned up to take the railway at about 11.30 am only to find it was not running so had to take the stairs instead .
2	We walked out , not too happy , and found a number of people sheltering in some buggies still waiting for taxies after 30 minutes .
2	We walked someway down for more scenic views , but this is not signposted so just go for a stroll .
2	We went on a day excursion from Croatia to Venice which had been sold to us by Thomson reps. The very early coach ( 6am ) left the hotel promptly , but did not have any aircon in 27 degree temperature which made it a difficult transfer .
2	We were allocated 50mins and by the time you change and swim it 's already time go back on the bus .
2	We were extremely unsatisfied and would not recommend it to anyone .
2	We were informed gondola prices were almost double what they were offering and if you bought in Venice .
2	We were rip-offed slightly as we chose to do the cable car when we first arrived in Dubrovnik .
2	We were sat that far apart we could not even hold our hand out and reach each other .
2	We were shown their package deals and informed that many of these were reduced , however when we attempted to purchase at the lower price we were informed the price was never lowered and made to feel as though we were lying , despite many other passengers agreeing with us .
2	We were told that " it would not be the best lunch of our lives " but this was a major understatement .
2	We were ushered into the back room of a restaurant , squashed in like sardines where we could not even get out from our seats once we were in .
2	We would recommend you pass on the cable car .
2	Well the emergency number is included on a leaflet they give you and nowadays you can get as much data as you like on your mobile phone for £3 for a day to find your way around !
2	Went up at sunset and it was spoilt by a foreground of a cable car and its cables in front of a dying sun .
2	What 's more , the bar at the top of the cable car was extortionate - 57kuna for a bottled beer .
2	What we did not realise that we were going to be second class citizens on the boat ride .
2	When booking we were shocked that it was over double the price to go and return when it was not a day return .
2	When the trip started , we have had a short introduction of our trip , but I failed to hear everything as the skipper was speaking quietly .
2	When they built this cable car they did not plan well for tourists .
2	When we booked our trip to Venice , they promised us transfer and a 4 hour guided tour included in the total price .
2	When we got up to the terrace , we found it even more disappointing , since the cables were seen on the photos and there is no way to take a photograph , without those black lines .
2	When we reached the top , they had just closed down the ticket office ( even though there were still lots of people to go down and it was not closing ...
2	When we went inside the cabin , we were going to die - it was so hot and there were around 20 people inside , so the ride was more than awful .
2	When we went to the Tickets Point we found out that the ticket was 120Kn which was a bit too much for the facility .
2	While that sounds impressive , that 's not really a point to brag about .
2	Why not avoid extortionate old town parking costs ( up to 50kuna per hour ) drive up the hill to the top of the cable car , take the car down , explor...
2	Will not ride again .
2	Win some you lose some !
2	Wish we had not bothered as we got to the spot AFTER the walkers ( and we too had to walk about 30 minutes ) ; could barely hear the tour guides over the noise of the boat and was very uncomfortable .
2	With such an early start we thought we could have a sleep ready for a long and exciting day ahead of us .
2	Would have been a different story if they told us when we were buying the ticket or gave us a refund .
2	Would not bother going up there again .
2	Would not waste the money or the time .
2	Yes , the view is nice but you get a much nicer view from the walls around the old town .
2	You are going up on a cable car . it 's not special guys . the only reason why people use it is because when you get off , theres a place to see the view . you can access the mountain by car and it 's just as good if you find the right cab driver . plus , theres more to see on the sides of the mount...
2	You are not even high enough to see over the cables and the cables run right over the old town below so you can not even get a good picture .
2	You can not criticise a view of any kind of Dubrovnik - but commercially and in every other way this is poorly thought out .
2	You can see their reviews below .
2	You go up , look around for a few minutes and then come down , not exactly thrilling or worth the money .
2	You had to pay 30 euro each for an extra shuttle service that took you from the dock to the city centre and back .
2	You need 3 hours minimum 2 hours to wait in line , ride the car and spend a few min at the top .
2	You pay a lot for go up and when yopu arrive there .... nothing ! you can just take some photos ( if you are lucky and there is no fog ) .
3	We visited the cable car as part of our tour off the cruise ship .
3	Cost 100 kunar , approx £10.00 return
3	We saw cab signs offering an hour of touring around the area for about 8 quid so you could go wherever you like including the top of the cable car .
3	Napoleon built a defensive fort which became critical defense during the Croatian war
3	You can easily walk up the hill in a variety of ways .
3	Compared to other funiculars I have been on , it looked liked this would only take 3 minutes to go up and down .
3	Shortest furnicular in the world .
3	The track length is only 66 m .
3	It is the shortest funicular railway I have seen in my life .
3	And it is actually according to the wikipedia ( it is the shortes in the WORLD ) .
3	However , there are stairs around the side and you can take them up or down .
3	At least 3 couples were having their shots taken there .
3	The car moves fairly quickly but is not over crowded .
3	At the top is is a restaurant and souvenir shop .
3	If you are able , maybe consider walking up to the top .
3	I booked and confirmed for a car from the Port in Dubrovnik to a hotel near the airport .
3	I booked rather late the night before but got a prompt response with pricing , confirmation and drivers name and information .
3	I booked a return trip for a group of 6 .
3	We got two taxis to get our group to Trogir .
3	We wanted a taxi to our nearby hotel .
3	This situation will continue for a further 2 years until the new Trogir bridge is opened .
3	The cost of entry to the waterfalls is 23kuna .
3	Just take photos .
3	We stopped once to have a swim .
3	The picture is of the lake in the national park .
3	Once on the boat the guides told us all our options .
3	It takes about 25 minutes and someone from the boat will take you there and show the way .
3	After that the guiding stops .
3	But you can just walk around and visit all the usual places .
3	If you are with a group of 6 people you can hop on a gondela .
3	It 's about 80 euro .
3	All and all the Venezia Lines Ferry is just a ferry to Venice .
3	It takes you there and back again .
3	No comment on the trip itself .
3	We were travelling on the line for a couple of days in Venice .
3	We thought that it was due to the luggage we were taking .
3	We sailed from Rovinj , Croatia to Venice .
3	Whilst on the ship , we were told about the packages and offers available from the Venezia Lines tour guides .
3	We were offered the whole package for 80 euros each so we decided that would be the best way to enjoy Venice in a few hours .
3	The package included : a water transfer from the ship to St Mark 's Square ; a guided tour of St Mark 's Square ; lunch ; gondola ride and water taxi back to the ship to head back .
3	Starting from the beginning ; the water transfer to St Mark 's Square was an alternative to a brisk walk of 45 minutes .
3	It was , by this time , 1:55 pm and we were supposed to be getting the Gondola ride at 2pm so we assumed we would be going straight from the restaurant with the guides .
3	We took a ferry trip from Porec , Croatia to Venice .
3	But make sure to go by car  bus to the Italian coast .
3	We arrived and took a walking tour to the main square .
3	We eventually arrived back at the hotel at 9pm .
3	The trip was ordered through a very nice travel agent in Novigrad , Croatia for my mother and 85 year old grandmother .
3	She bought a boat taxi round trip to and from the Venezia Lines Ferry for 15 euros per person .
3	From Porec there was around a 2 and a half hour journey in to Venice .
3	They then spilt the cabin in to 2 sections , and stand at the front with a microphone and a map to ' inform ' you about Venice .
3	We were told during their sales pitches that a gondola will cost up to €200 . ( Well this is what you go to Venice for ) and for someone that had never been before felt that if we took their deal of €26 for a gondola ride was a great saving .
3	We had to meet at St Marks Square at 2pm and practically the whole ferry was there , and then made our way to the gondola .
3	We arrived back in to Rovinj about 8:45 pm .
3	Day trip to Venice .
3	We used the company for a trip from Porec to Venice .
3	We were informed that boarding opened at 7:15 /7:30 , leaving by 8 .
3	In the Napoleonic Fort houses a photographic exhibition about the war .
3	You can either get a return journey or go up the cable car and walk down .
3	Entrance cost 30 kn and I purchased my tickets with my cable car ticket 100kn .
3	The is a news reel footage of the seige .
3	One way is 85 kuna and a return journey I got for 140 kuna .
3	Queue can be expected at times , both at the top and on the ground , depends on the number of travellers .
3	Opening time is from 09.00 but closing time is month-based .
3	Cost per an adult round-trip ticket is 140 kn .
3	There are lots of tour groups visiting so queue was very long later .
3	We got here just after opening so hardly any queue .
3	We did not wait long to ride the cable car - perhaps we timed it right as it was suggested early in the day might be quieter .
3	Do it early before the long lines form once the cruise ships hit town
3	No need to take a taxi to get there , you just walk right thru the old town to find it .
3	I did not realize we would go so high .
3	Went on the cable car mid morning .
3	Cost is 100 kuna ( they will not accept euros ) tickets can be bought at the souvenir shop just a short walk away , or they can be bought at the cable car entrance .
3	The ride is quite short , maybe no more than 5 minutes .
3	Go at 9:00 to avoid the crowds .
3	Can be crowded if you arrive close to sunsets .
3	You can buy tickets when you arrive .
3	Cable car can be good value depending on the size of your group and number of adults - 80 kuna ( one way ) and 130 kuna ( round trip ) per ticket gets pricey with a large group .
3	In the summer , especially around sunset expect the car that takes you up to be filled with people .
3	In my opinion , there was no need to do this in advanced .
3	That may be something to consider before you buy the tickets .
3	We went at approximately 6pm in time for sunset .
3	Remember to thank your children for behaving responsibly in public and remind yourself that your values may not be grid by everyone .
3	Walk through the exhibit and gain a .
3	Ew understanding .
3	You can purchase tickets at an official booth at the bottom of the hill near Ploce Gate before the entrance ( cash only ) , or alternatively purchase at the entrance but lines are longer there .
3	The departure point is a short walk from Ploce Gate in Old Town , and the overall ride is 3-4 minutes .
3	My one piece of advice - buy your tickets in advance .
3	Buy your tickets in the old town or any agency , i do not know if they cost any more but it 's well worth avoiding the 45 minute wait in the sweltering heat .
3	Tip - purchase tickets online prior to going , to avoid queue , they are valid for months , so no need to have exact date .
3	Price 22Eur or 150 Kuna . buy them at shops at the city walls so you could skip the queue at the entrance
3	Not busy in April but when cruise ships are in it may be different .
3	The cable car goes and comes back every 10 mins .
3	Only downside was the toilets , I 'd hold It till I got back down if I were you .
3	The last car is midnight , in the summer months , so no rush to get down !
3	Definitely go as early as possible in the morning as it gets very busy .
3	I believe it can be busy If buses have dropped off tourists from the cruise ships ( avoid at these times ) .
3	Return ticket is about £10 or you can get a one way ticket for £6 and walk back down .
3	We took the #1 bus from Gruz and made the short ( 5 minute ) walk to the lower ticket booth .
3	The price was 100 kuna each , return , regardless which of the three ticket centers you purchased from .
3	We also could have taken the #8 directly to the cable car entrance , but these run less frequently .
3	Went up with my husband today .
3	Approximately 30 guests inside each car .
3	Then we made the short ( 1 minute ) walk up to the cable car entrance .
3	There is also a restaurant and gift shop .
3	The breeze was cooling given the hit sun .
3	We had considered the walking trail , approximately 45 mins of switchbacks to gain the 400 meters elevation ( relatively easy hike ) , but when we saw how totally exposed it was to the sun we were happy we did not .
3	The wind whipped up before we went and they suspended the service , so very safety conscious .
3	Buy the ticket online or at the actual cable car hub as it is cheaper than the “ non-commission ” vendors .
3	On the day we visited the Old town unfortunately it was raining in the morning so the cable car stopped running luckily it brightened up in fact it became a very very hot day and we were able to go on the cable car The queue goes very very quickly but you do need a ticket before you get on you can p...
3	Includes English videos of news reel at time of conflict .
3	The ride takes about two and a half minutes .
3	You can choose a one-way or two way ticket . 140 kn for a two-way trip and 80 kn for a one-way trip .
3	Go early or late , as the lines will be long , especially if there are many large ships in the harbor .
3	Much of the information is in English , and there is a short film with BBC footage about the struggles of 1991 and beyond .
3	Gift shop , toilets and restaurant are all available at the top .
3	We finally got up on our 4th attempt .
3	Easy to find from the Old Town and luckily no crowds . 94 Euros for a return ticket and then you had to pay extra if you wanted to visit the War museum .
3	The cable car closes if it is high winds so make sure to plan your trip around the weather .
3	We were in Dubrovnik for 4 days and it was only open out of 2 of these days .
3	It works out at about £10 per person for a return trip to the top .
3	The ride costs about £10 per person for the round trip .
3	The tickets can be bought from local shops or direct from the entrance to the cable car .
3	The tickets can be purchased either at a kiosk near the base of the hill or at a second kiosk near the embarkation point .
3	The trip takes about ten minutes or so .
3	There are two viewing platforms once you arrive at the top of the cable car .
3	You can see the effects of the war on the fort next door .
3	There is a frame in the building at the top that has pictures from the 1991-1992 War and some of the devastation after the bombings .
3	There is a restaurant up there for coffee or lunch . .
3	You can buy tickets from the two small outlets facing Vrata od Buže ( the northern gate to the city walls ) .
3	There is a small shop at the top and a restaurant with both inside and outside seating .
3	Hence , I had to take the gondola up the mountain to see Dubrovnik from an eagle 's perspective .
3	Or after the cruise tours end .
3	There is also a somber reminder of Dubrovnik 's recent history during the homeland war ..... a tribute to the ' Defenders of Dubrovnik ' during it 's ...
3	It takes about 3 -4 minutes to the top .
3	The cable car was about 108 kuna return .
3	You can see the old town from the top .
3	I think that we were a bit early for the start of the season
3	We were in Dubrovnik on the last stop on our cruise out of Venice .
3	We rode the cable car up Mt Srd and walked down the mountain .
3	Takes about 10 minutes in the cable car
3	120 kunas for a return trip .
3	Puts Dubrovnik into full context .
3	Alternatively you could hike for 30 minutes .
3	The cable car station is quite near the Old Town .
3	We got it as a free pass with one of our tours and its probably the way to go .
3	The ride is rather short .
3	Go to the top : but walk it ( 90 minutes ) or get a taxi .
3	We drove up Mt Srd instead of taking the cable car .
3	We arrived about 11am and had to queue .
3	We booked an uber instead .
3	The journey is short about 5 minutes .
3	It seems so futile and reminds you that it only happened 25 years ago .
3	Visit the Homeland War Museum for a moving account of the 1991 conflict .
3	Only a step away from the city entrance .
3	This activity does not take long .
3	My husband and I just sat in the amphitheatre for a couple hours taking it all in .
3	On top , we also did an ATV excursion to see more of the area and see the effects of the last war .

3	I think - as others have said - you may be wise to simply get the funicular up the hill and then take the serpantine path back down .

3	Also there is a small amphitheatre and a large stone cross that has been built up there .

4	Great views - fascinating museum of civil war but a little dry for children / teenagers .
4	There is a outside cafe for a drink , a forlorn looking " quality " restaurant , and shop .
4	This is pricey for a family of four , but the view at the top is pretty good .
4	Good photography exhibition .
4	I did this as part of the tour from my cruise wonderful views from the top and views of the mountainous area behind , nice to see the feral goats .
4	The trip up in the cable car gives you the opportunity of seeing the old town unfold as you slowly ascend .
4	The only downside is the long queues that can form after mid day and especially when cruise ships are in port. Still if you time it right it is well worth it .
4	I chose to walk down which is not too difficult so long as you are prepared for walking on the trail in the sun .
4	While visiting Dubrovnik be sure you take the cable cars to the highest point .
4	As you near the top the whole of Dubrovnik and it ’ s islands come into view .
4	The trip is worth it for the amazing view !
4	Wait can be long ; we found the line had shortened considerably at 1pm .
4	My partner rate this as the second most necessary thing to do in Dubrovnik , after walking the tops of the fortification walls .

4	The views from the top of the mountain down over the Old City of Dubrovnik are spectacular and surely should not be missed .

4	A visit without this view at the top would be sad .

4	Worth it for the view but drinks very expensive just be prepared .
4	The cable cars are in excellent condition .
4	We ate lunch at the top which was also pricey but the view was worth it and the food was good .
4	It 's a quick ride and some would call it pricey but we felt it was worth every penny .
4	We wanted to do the off-road buggy tour ( see separate review ) so had to go up in the cable car but the views really were breathtaking .
4	The cable car is worth the money just for the stunning panoramic views .
4	There is a gift shop and restaurant at the top and you can walk down ( apparently takes about an hour and you need to wear sensible shoes - our flip flops would not have cut it ! ) worth the money if you are going to spend some time at the top and not just do the 6 minute round trip !
4	I have done the cable car ride two times now and it 's always nice to enjoy the beautiful view down to Dubrovnik .
4	I think the price is still ok for the experience , but if it goes higher I 'd think twice .
4	The restaurant is nice but also so popular you need to wait for a table .
4	My 2,5 years old nephew had a blast , so nice experience for kids too .
4	The ticket prices are a little steep but you get great views of the old town and along the coastline from the upper station and the cable car itself .
4	The price for the cable car is reasonable but you feel like you need to spend a little more time at the top than necessary , just to make the trip worth the money !
4	There is a restaurant you can eat at , which did look lovely , especially if you time it with when the sun is setting , but the menu is not as extensive as some restaurants in the Old Town .
4	The views at the top are fantastic but you can literally see everything in 10minutes , take a few photos and go back down again !
4	The journey is up and down is very quick , the ticketing is very efficient with a kiosk and turnstile .
4	The cable cars are spacious so you can walk around and get a view from all angles .
4	Cable ride itself is super quick .
4	Views from the top are stunning .
4	The war museum is worth a visit though .
4	For the best experience you would be with someone who could point out what you are seeing , e.g. where the battery which rained shells on Dubrovnik was located , etc .
4	There are a range of eating and drinking options at the top , inside and out ...... reasonable given that you are really a captive audience .
4	But you are not really there for the food ...... the views are what take your breath away and help you understand why this , Dubrovnik , is a UNESCO World Heritage site .
4	The views are simply spectacular .
4	The view was nice and I am not sure if its included in a reservation the Panorama restaurant thats perched up at the top either .

4	Great views at the top .
4	Car holds 30 people and they do try and fill it , ok and not cramped , good views of dubrovnik and surrounding islands on a clear day and nice restaurant bar when you reach the top which was busy Museum which we did not see so will have to go back : - ) and also sample the restaurant as we only had ...
4	A great - if not exactly cheap - way to reach one of the most stunning views in Europe .
4	The cable car ride itself is over very quickly but it 's worth it to get to the top of Mount Srd and enjoy the views .
4	The fort , cafe and adventure tourism at the top of the hill at Srdj also worth a look around .
4	This is well worth doing but should take no more than a couple of hours .
4	Great view of the entire area and especially of Old Town .
4	Even though you may have to wait a while to get on the cable car the views at the top over the old town of Dubrovnik is a must do so please endure !
4	We did not go to the war museum but after talking to other people I wish we would have so I would recommend it .
4	There is a restaurant , a memorial , a museum , a shop and several viewing points and platforms to enjoy .
4	The journey is fairly short but the views are spectacular .
4	It 's a relatively short ride to the top , the views are worth it ( costs 108k ish per adult ) .
4	If you are lucky you can sometimes get an amazing table in the restaurant at the top at the edge of the hill which has stunning views .
4	Make certain it 's a fine day with little wind The view of Dubrovnik from the top is stunning you see how beautiful and small Dubrovnik actually is and how well fortified the town is however from the top easy to bombard Great views worth the visit

4	There is a really nice Panorama restaurant at the top .
4	Perhaps a little bit expensive for a very short trip but worth it in the end .
4	The views are spectacular and there are many view points around .
4	Worth doing for great sunset views of the Old Town .
4	Its all about the view from the top , amazing !
4	The table turnover at the cafe was actually quick so we managed a nice drink with a view before heading down .
4	Beautiful views from the top which you can wander around in about 20-30 minutes .

4	Cofee should be better , but because of the view its very nice experience .
4	Great views of the town from the car , and from the hill above .
4	From the top you have incredible view .
4	We went up at early evening , watched sunset and came back in dark - magical .
4	Be prepared to push to get to front of car for best views - and then treat yourself to meal at restaurant at top to enjoy the views at your leisure .
4	It is a short ride ( 3 minutes ? ) but very worth while as it gives you amazing views across bay , islands and old town .
4	Also the temperature drops a few degrees when you are up there so a great place to go during the day .
4	Do not forget to look inland - beautiful mountain ranges and remote villages .
4	Busy Dubrovnik cable cars go up and down a very steep incline providing a great view of the surrounding area .

4	The view is amazing - the restaurant at the top is pricy There is a homeland war museum at the top which was .
4	Good decision as we looked at the queue , the crowded cars and the cacophony of commentaries for the various groups .
4	We could still savour the breathtaking view from the cable car station but what was interesting was the monument to those who perished in the 1991-1995 War , marked by a white cross and the symbol of a fallen angel .
4	There was the ability to take spectacular photos from high above the town of both the city and surrounding areas .
4	When you get off the views are great , but for the best go to the War Museum , pay the fee , see the exhibit , then walk up the two old staircases to come out on top of the old Imperial Fort for priceless views .

4	Watching the sun go down over the islands is quite special ( although we could not get a great angle for perfect photos if you are a keen photographer ) .

4	It 's a quick ride up , nothing scary if you are not keen on heights and we had a look round and came back down .

5	Having bought a ticket we only had to wait approx 5 mins and in the height of tourist season is great .
