5	Absolutely fantastic !
5	Absolutely worth the visit .
5	After enjoying walking around the top area and checking out the sights , we found a weary looking couple who had walked up , gave them our unwanted tickets then found the path and descended on foot .
5	After that tAke a deep breath and enjoy the ride both ways .
5	Afterwards we walked to local village Bosanka ( about a mile ) and had a terrific lunch at KonobaDubrava - well worth the walk !
5	Again , another spectacular view of the walled city , just a different perspective .
5	All in all , not to be missed !
5	Allow time to take in the view from the café at the top .
5	Alongwith that , there is a restaurant up here where you can enjoy your meal with this view .
5	also a great museum worth visiting which shows the story of the recent war with actual footage from the time .

5	Although I do not have a head for heights , I really enjoyed the cable car !
5	Although it is expensive it is a great joy to ride it .

5	An exceptional and must-see view of Dubrovnik's Old Town and coastline, as well as of Montenegro 's mountain , both from the cable car and the multilevelled platform at the top of Mount Srd ! 
5	And do not stop there ; climb the steep stairs to the top of the fort and the views are even better , not least because the cables of the cable car are not in the way .
5	And it is not expensive !
5	And we lucked out as it was right before sunset began .
5	Another tick off the list , Stunning views beautiful restaurant at the top off the mountain if you do not do anything else DO this  .
5	As another reviewer advised , try to go to the ' rear ' of the car for the best view out at the city as you ascend or descend .
5	As another Tripadvisor reviewer commented , the view is best from the top floor of the War Museum housed in the old fort originally built by Napoleon that was the protector of Dubrovnik during the 1990s siege .
4	The view captured was amazing but felt dangerous .
4	The highlight of the trip was definitely a visit to the Fort which includes great displays and a video of the Yugoslav war .
4	The trip may not be cheap but then not many such things are in such a tourist hotspot .
4	Its not a cheery subject but I felt was well worth the £3 entry fee .
4	The cable car is really worth the trip , we loved it , the view from the top was amazing and gave you a good idea of the area
4	You also get a great view from the to of the fort which avoids the cable car .
4	That said , the view of the Old Town and the Adriatic were well worth the investment .
4	You are dropped off at the far side where you get great views of the city and surroundings .
4	The trip is smooth and not terrifying even for scaredy cats like me !
4	There is a gift shop there too ( of course ! ) Definitely worth a go if you do not mind queuing !
4	The cable car itself offered fantastic view of the surrounding area but you were not in long and were also squashed in with a huge group of other tourists so the views would not be great if you do not get close to the outer window !
4	Amazong views across Dubrovnik , and the sun sets over the mountains .
4	I highly recommend to go cable car in the morning when there is not so hot weather and lot of people yet .
4	There is very very beautiful view from the cable car and from the hill .
4	There is also very intresting war museum in the hill , I really got some science moments there to thinking destinies of the Croatian people 20y ago .
4	I 'd do it mostly for the views .
4	Looked like fun .
4	To sit on a sunny afternoon with a glass of very nice Croatian wine and see the city from on high is a must when you are in Dubrovnik
4	If you spend money to travel all the way to dubrovnik you have to get on top and check the views .
4	The views are amazing and the restaurant at the top very good .
4	Stunning views of the old town as well as the surrounding areas .
4	Pleasantly surprised .
4	Dom't be alarmed where I state at a good pace my wife is not one for heights or speed but found the journey quite pleasant , Once we disembarked the views were quite stunning overlooking the Old Town and Harbour to the naked eye .
4	You can see down onto Lapad , over to the islands and across to the setting sun .
4	The cars run regularly and hold probably about 20 so unless it 's really busy you should not have to wait too long as it 's only a few minutes to the top .
4	The facility at the top is nice , there is a gift shop , toilets and even a restaurant alongside several terraces which are all very new .
4	There are plenty of places on the terraces to take photos , but the better photos are probably outside of the railings on the hillside .
4	We both used the toilets and were very clean , well maintained and modern . whilst waiting to go back down I did notice the cable car coming up was only half full is it value for money I would have to say yes because you can not go to Dubrovnik with out doing the Wall and the Cable car but if I had ...
4	I took some excellent photos but then I did have a 70mm-300mm lens , where I may be wrong but people there using a camera phone would not record the same image , we did not use the outside Restaurant at the top which was waitress service and looked very proficient with waitresses looking after there...
4	Definitely do it to see the gorgeous view of oldtown and the see beyond and the town ( where the locals live i assume ) from the top .
4	There is a restaurant at top with great view ( I did not budget time to try the food myself ) .
4	The cable car takes you up to the top giving great views of the old town .
4	If you are stuck for time this is not something I would recommend as views from the islands are just as good and they are much more fun to visit but if you are in Dubrovnik for a while and want to see Dubrovnik from above then this is the best way to get there .
4	For photography lovers this is a great place to take photos .
4	We view from the top of the cable car was incredible , but there is not anything else to do up there if you do not want to spend a fortune in the restaurant .
4	We walked down to Konoba Dubrava which was a lovely restaurant .
4	The cable car journey itself is not too much to write home about but it is so worth it when you are at the top looking over the city and surrounding areas .
4	Every angle gives you a different view entirely .
4	Great views of the old city , cafe at the top .
4	Well worth a visit
4	A must-see for first time visitors .
4	The restaurant at the top is a fantastic place to sit for a drink and look out over the vista .
4	Stunning view of the city .
4	This is a great thing to do in Dubrovnik but do yourself a favour , wear comfortable shoes and hike down the hill as the views are spectacular .
4	Family trip with younger children - the process was simple enough , the trip itself went smooth , and the view is really pretty .
4	We went for the climb instead - and I am glad we did .
4	Had heard how good this trip was and was not disappointed .
4	Great views of Dubrovnik and the coast .
4	The top holds some great views , and tasty cocktails , but we felt like the day would have been over a bit quickly if we 'd got the cable car both ways .
4	Nonetheless , the cable car experience itself is a pleasure , and well worth a look - and if you do find yourself with time to kill at the top , there is always the buggies ...
4	As cable cars go , this experience was pretty good
4	It was a beautiful night , the views were awesome .
4	I 'd recommend getting the war memorial ticket as well , despite being small it was quite informative and views from the top of the fort were almost better than the crowded panorama spot .
4	Cable car was quite good and views from the top are great over the old and new parts of Dubrovnik .
4	Food , weather , sights , everything was wonderful .
4	Very efficient but they take advantage of the fact that it ’ s pretty much the only way to get up there by charging you a fortune - views are once in a lifetime though .
4	Line up in front for the cable car to go to the front and get the best view .
4	Quick , easy way to reach the mountain and get a great view .
4	I recommend this town for everyone .
4	It 's very beautiful .
4	This is a great attraction to add to your visit to Dubrovnik , we have been there before so we made this our first point of call to avoid the queues , if you have a few cruise ships in it can be very busy .
4	We had a great time and a excellent guide .
4	There is also a old fort a few minutes walk away when you reach the top that houses a exhibition on the 91-95 war and this is well worth a visit for 4 euros .
4	The views from the top of the cable car run are awesome and among the best we have ever seen and we were lucky to be there when it was relatively quiet so we could take our time and really absorb it all .
4	The views are worth going to the top of the mountain for , you can see the walled city and surrounding islands .
4	We walked down and although the path we chose was rough in places it was an enjoyable 30 minute walk to a well earned beer at the bottom !
4	The Homeland War exhibition in the old fort is also very good although I would have liked to have English subtitles on the video .
4	Excellent experience and views well worth a visit would say to do yhis first before the wall as to miss queues
4	Really nice views
4	You can see the old town , the scattered islands and on a really good day , even the neighbouring countries .
4	But regardless of how you get there , the breathtaking view is definitely worth it !
4	Luckily I decided to sit by the rocks in the cliff so I enjoyed my personal space there whilst the sun was setting beautifully .
3	A stairway leading down is the one we were meant to take .
3	We arrived at the bottom of the cable car around 11am and waited in line for about 15 minutes .
3	If your trip is anything like ours , you will be walking and climbing a lot while in Dubrovnik .
3	It is a bit of a uphill climb alongside the roadway .
3	We walked to the Cable Car from Pile Gate using the sidewalk just outside the Old City Walls .
3	The cable car in Dubrovnik is a big attraction so it 's likely you will have to queue during busy times .
3	We ended up having a bite to eat at the restaurant where the service was good but the food was just average .
3	We queued for nearly 2 hours in the heat , but I 'd still say it was worth it !
3	We returned to the Stradun using the Buza Gate , which brings you to several flights of steps ... fortunately all downhill .
3	Over here also , it can be very busy to get up the steps to the viewing point .
3	Although we did enjoy walking down the path it 's not for the feint hearted , especially on a hot summers day !
3	We used the cable car to get up to the top and opted to walk down the path .
3	It 's not hard to work out where the cable car departs from , just follow the lines down the hillside to a little outside of the city walls .
3	It costs 130 HRK per person for a round trip which at present is about £15 at current rates .
3	Went up with no great expectations .
3	We got there gone mid day and they do pack you in at that time you have no room to move about , As we were at the front of the Queue we managed to stand in prime position at the back of the car as a DSLR camera Enthusiast I want to get some great pictures whilst the car was moving , I was disappoint...
3	In terms of going up at sunset , I 'd say the better views to be had are over past the fort along the road to the west ( past where the buggies are kept ) .
3	Interestingly an Uber driver that we saw later said that he would have driven us up there for 100 HRK , so there is that option if you really do not fancy the cable car !
3	Granted , there are some dangers with this , but be sure footed and you will be fine !
3	There is a small shop and a restaurant at the top .
3	And there is exhibition of the Serbian aggression from the 90s at the top .
3	It costs 120 kuna per person to go up the cable car .
3	Hike the city walls if you must do the excercise !
3	Viewing platform and shop too , cost 10kuna .
3	We went later afternoon and it wasn ’ t too crowded .
3	We made use of the cable car in July 2019 .
3	Our last night in Dubrovnik my daughter and I took the cable car up to Panorama Restaurant and the Homeland War Museum .
3	The short trip is a bit expensive at approx €18 return ticket but it is worth it for the beautiful views over Dubrovnik .
3	From the cable car you can se the town .
3	There is a terraced cafe and an indoor restaurant and the choice of returning to the bottom by cable car or walking down .
3	Took cable car up had some lunch at top , visited the war museum then took walk down for some photos .
3	Got there at the right time late afternoon , no queues to get the ticket nor crowd to be sandwiched in the cable car .
3	There were only 2 cable cars in rotation as far as I can remember so the ride up and down however was very quick .
3	There is also a museum nearby which we skipped so no comments on that .
3	Good footwear is a must .
3	We took in the tour of the old fort , which is now a museum to remember the 1991 seige .
3	A good trip and if you are energetic , there is a trail down which gives you a good walk
3	Be prepared to queue up and avoid days when cruise ships are docked , or it will take a good while to get to the top .
3	Cost 80 kuna ( £10 ) .
3	Pay 85 kunas to take the cable car up , then walk the zig zag path down .
3	Like everything in Dubrovnik , this is expensive , but it 's a must-do .
3	There is a restaurant if you want to stay longer and I guess that would make it more worthwhile , but of course at an extra price .
3	Going down took us 45-50 minutes .
3	Walking up will take 1-1.5 hour .
3	You can also rent a donkey or mountain bike to explore further ( when the donkey / bike man is up there ) unless I have been taken in by a Croatian pr...
3	Took a trip on the cable car with friends on a trip to Dubrovnik last week .
3	Frequent trips up and down-just spend as much time as you want up there .
3	You do not have a time limit at the top but you do not particularly spend that long here so coincide it with some other plans that day rather than thi...
3	The cable car fits about 25 people and can get quite warm in the cabin .
3	You can travel back down when you are ready and there is the humpy bit on the way down too , There can be quite big queues to come down so be prepared...
3	The site was of great importance in the defense of the city in the ' 90s war .
3	We explored the area but did not do a ' walk ' , but there seemed plenty of opportunity with a road running to the left and right , as well as tracks ...
3	Dubrovnik cable car is expensive but really needs to be done , the view is fantastic , spend as much time as you like at the top , food and drink avai...
3	The Terrace restaurant is a great place to have a drink - food is ok but not great , you are paying for the view .
3	And then you want to give up because it 's hot and you might be slightly hungover or hungry but then you catch a glimpse of Stari Grad in the distance...
3	The quality of the food is good , the prices reasonable and the service excellent .
3	The views are obviously great , but there missing a trick with no bar or coffee shop to hold onto the punters once up there .
3	There are wonderful views from the top cable car station , but not much else to do when you get there .
3	Although the views at the top are great , the cost is not added to this there was an exhibition at the top for which they wanted you to pay more money...
3	Walk down the paved path and walk toward the sea where a little dirt trail veers off the main path .
3	Whereas , the glass walls by the cable car ruin the view in pictures .
3	The thing is that you can skip the lines , save the high ticket price and get to s similar viewing point by taxi ( which will cost you less than the c...
3	There is a toilet and cafe on top of the hill too .
3	We went up in the cable car around 5pm and after walking from the pile gate to the cable car were already quite hot and sweaty as it was still very wa...
3	Its more expensive that other things you can do but if you 'd like to get a photo of old town then this is a great location .
3	The cable car itself is 150kn for a return trip or 85k if you want to go one way and walk / car down .
3	If you are interested in the cable car , plan your arrival carefully .
3	Opens at 9:00 and the tour buses and cruise ships deliver their hoards of tourists then .
3	Afternoon is much better !
3	The views are great , but the cable car journey is minutes .
3	Very fast ride by cable car .
3	My wife and I went up around 19:00 .
2	The path is windy and long and made even more difficult by the use of loose and very slippy stones used on the path .
2	Slight pity the viewing platforms both look out the wrong way , but theres one spot where you can get photos without the cables showing if you have a slight zoom on your camera .
2	Did not actually ride this one , only watched other people while waiting for bus .
2	There is a fortress at the top , many people came back quite soon .
2	The previous day the cable car was not in service they stated due to technical reasons so we returned the following day we bought our Tickets from the shop at the bottom of the hill to the Cable station although you can buy when you get there .
2	There is the issue of getting back down though ...
2	It just zigzag in not so pretty and no shade areas .
2	In comparison the hike to top is boring .
2	The place to watch the sunset , food not so good in the alfresco Resaraunt , shame really .
2	Also the lines to get back on the cable car to come down are lengthy . .
2	Not for the feint hearted if you do not like heights
2	Unfortunately , the cable lines ruin some of the pictures .
2	Actually seeing the film footage of the fort we were in being bombed really brought it home to us .
2	I think it 's quite expensive for what it is .
2	There is a restaurant there that was very pricey , but it was fully reserved when we went .
2	So instead my friends watched the sunset from the viewing platform which randomly got way too crowded just before .
2	There are other ways to get up there that might be more economical .
2	Our plan to have a mid morning drink and snack at the restaurant / cafe was thwarted because the whole place was reserved and , sure enough , a large group following their tour leader arrived in the next two cars . ( Groups of people following a tour guide is quite the thing in this city ) .
2	The cable car goes by too quickly and because it 's packed , you may not get good photos .
2	At around £12 its not cheap .
2	It 's a very short , very expensive ride .
2	I would skip it if I had known .
2	It was very expensive to use the cable car and when you get to the top the views are certainly excellent but it does not take long to take it all in .
2	I personally thought it was overpriced for what it was . 149.00 kunas .
2	The queues to get up and down were horrendous ! !
2	I would not bother with it unless the price goes down .
2	It was 96 kuna per adult which was a lot to go up a hill and back down .
2	The cables from the cable car also are in every picture , detracting from the aesthetics .
2	It is too high for a short ride . 130 HRK adult return , 80 HRK adult one way , 60 HRK for child above 4-yr .
2	Had I knew this , I would have taken a taxi which would have been cheaper for the family .
2	I do not know who the idiot was who thought it was a good idea to design the cable car so the old city was one side of the cables and the viewing platform the other .
2	They informed us the sea was choppy ( which everyone knew ) and that the trip would take longer than the planned time , we were not told how much longer .
2	They jam you in , so there â€°Ã›Âª s no way to get photos on the ride up .
2	They outright lied to me , and are still trying to claim my flight " was not endangered " .
2	They picked me up from my hotel over 45 minutes late .Ã¥ÃŠ
2	They played on peoples insecurity of not having been on the city .
2	They refused saying the driver waited from 03:55 to 04:45 .
2	They refused to arrange an alternate transfer and refused to pay the difference of a new transfer ( which on the day for such a difference was double the price ) .
2	They refused to take our desired route saying the high way is faster .
2	They said they came on the original day but the hotel assured us they did not .
2	They sold us a return ticket just before it closed ( we thought it closed at midnight ) without any notification that we wouldnt be able to use it .
2	They still charged the set amount even though they dropped us 1.5km from the place we had agreed .
2	They stopped us on the middle of the highway pay the entire amount now or leave the car .
2	They then crammed in too many people into each cable car , most of whom had been smoking at the bottom and then could not wait to get out at the top to have a fag then , too !
2	They then spilt the cabin in to 2 sections , and stand at the front with a microphone and a map to ' inform ' you about Venice .
2	They wanted us to go with the germans all squished like sardines in one taxi but we obviously refused since we were promised the mercedes van .
2	They went to Venice and everything went well and until they were on the went back .
2	They were supposed to pick us up from the hotel at 4:45 AM but instead of picking us up from the hotel , the driver called at 4:54 AM and said he was sorry that he will not be able to come .
2	They were very negative about not purchasing their tour elements .
2	They were waiting for us but outside the airport terminal so took a while to find Did not ring our apartment owner as requested on a number of occasions which meant some confusion when we arrived in Split old town .
2	They where rude on the phone .
2	This cable car thing is a cruise ship fuelled rip off and the most expensive such thing in the world !
2	This cable car tour is far too expensive for what is offered .
2	This cable car tour is far too expensive for what is offered .Ã¥ÃŠ
2	This company is DISHONEST and can not be trusted .
2	This experience left a very bad taste in our mouths , particularly the total indifference and lack of caring displayed by the cable car staff .
2	This here is like the wild Wild West .....
2	This is a ridiculous amount of money for such a short ride .Ã¥ÃŠ
2	This is a very very long and hard day and requires a lot of patience !
2	This is more expensive than a round trip ferry to Lokrum island , for example , which is a full day of fun .Ã¥ÃŠ
2	This is not a cheap thing to do and was not worth the money for us .
2	This is not really a tourist attraction .
2	This is terrible , starting from a badly organised queue to buy tickets to the badly organised queue to get back down .
2	This is the first time I have booked with this company and will not do say again .Ã¥ÃŠ
2	This is the same rule when taking any form of transport ; bus , train or ferry - no organized lines and queue jumpers for everything everywhere , especially the locals that know the system .
2	This is totally unacceptable !
2	This is what I was told : " Missus , you need to know that you are not our only customer today and not the only one with problems ! "
2	This is when the tour guide changed her explanation and clarified that they only speak Spanish so they needed to be near her for translated tour commentary .
2	This looked like a great way to get to upper town but unfortunately it is under construction , so you will have to use stairs .
2	This really is not worth it .
2	This route took 1 hour and 30 minutes instead of 40 on the motorway .
2	This seems to be a common tactic so , if going to Trogir , first ensure that they will take you to your destination and do not pay until they have done so .
1	Border security wait was about an hour and we  don't expected that .
1	 Not before . 
1	Our tour guide - Anna - was very hurried and disorganized .
1	The information she gave was sterile and impersonal - we could have gotten the same info by doing a google search .
1	They confirmed my booking emailing my with a wrong driver ` s phone number ; - They driver did not speak any word in English , they did not have change to my payment .
1	When we arrived at the small island , Anna told us all the wrong time ( in English and Spanish ) to be back at the boat .
1	( we only needed 3 taxis for 9 of us ) They refused to accept that this was a fault with their booking system and simply blamed the fact.
1	£12 ( approx 15 Euros ) per person is too expensive .
1	10 mins later and still with the same customer we walked away !
1	120kn for a return is a waste of money .
1	150 kn for a fast ride and then a huge line to go back !
1	2 weeks later and I have heard nothing from them .
1	20 sweaty people in a 2 square meter cable car .
1	3 days later email came through saying it was not 92 EURO as quoted but 213 EURO and I would have to accept the new amount before they could proceed .
1	30 people herded in to a carriage that should really only have held half that amount .
1	40 minutes into our journey we pointed out we were definitely going the wrong way - he had NO idea how to get to the airport and then had no idea we had a flight to catch .
1	40 € for 2 person to go up is basically too much !
1	45 minutes at the falls and 3 hours in Mostar meaning that our travel time was in excess of 8 hours !
1	45 minutes is not enough time at the waterfall .
1	5 minutes after the agreed time , I had a phone call from Connecttotransfers.com advising me “ to make alternative arrangements ” as they did not have a car or driver available .
1	A complete disgrace to the Croation people .
1	A disaster that will not happen again because I will not use your services again .
1	A few passengers looked awful unwell from the long drive and dehydration .
1	A fight broke out , young boys pushed elderly folks out of the way to get out first and we lost 80 minutes of our day in an un-air-conditioned glass hot box .
1	a total of 35 mins late , but we had left to the airport .
1	A total waste , if I knew this was the service they offered I would have just rented a car and gone myself .
1	A very short and expensive trip .
1	A very short ride for an expensive price of a view that was all most the same as that from the approach of a service bus .
1	A week had gone by and I e mailed the company to be told that they were still looking for a driver to assign to the transfer , and hope to provide me with a definite confirmation soon .
1	About 24 26 € for two trips of 2 minutes each , the view was nice but absolutely not worth the price , one of the most ridiculously overpriced things I have ever seen .
1	Absolute goons blackmailing us .
1	Absolute joke of customer service .
1	Absolute joke of a company , worst customer service I have ever come across .
1	Absolutely poor customer service only giving robotic replies not willing to understand or address my genuine grievances - without a doubt go with Octopus Transfers !
1	Absolutely shocking service , we were not met at the airport as the driver had been delayed .
1	Absolutely unacceptable .
1	After , they gave us the receipt that I have attached as a picture ( of course we payed cash because at this point the feeling was strange of secrets being said in their ears between managers so I would never give them my card .
1	After 20 minutes , I travelled into town to attempt to find the bus at another stop .
1	After 30 min of waiting under the sun we complained and said that in 2 minutes the promised " van " white mercedes would arrive .
1	After 30 minutes Anna did finally update us and said that the bus driver went to have “ teeth surgery ” after he dropped us off earlier , and that is why he was late .
1	After 30 minutes they rang to cancel the booking .
1	After I accepted another email came through saying they made a mistake and it would be 213 EURO after all .
1	After leaving my wife with the cases i had to walk to find the accommodation , which was across the very busy main road into Dubrovnik .
1	After much discussion they offered the number for a taxi company , but that company failed to pick up others so we waited out the storm and walked down in the dark , very late at night .
1	After not finding the bus , i called the tour operator who off the bat yelled at me on the phone claiming the bus had waited and was already on its way to Montenegro .
1	After one hour of looking and a call to the office ( message left , no one answered ) , we had to make other arrangements or waste the day .
1	After our first stop , we attempted to change seats as she had not announced any seating policy .
1	After requesting cancellation of transfers within minutes of making them and specifically requesting cancellation without charges - they did not specify they would deduct money and instead replied we have cancelled your transfers as requested .
1	After seeing the length and height of the cable car , we are happy to say that it would not be worth the money .
1	After spending 15 minutes at the top , we decided to get the cable car down again .
1	After that , I received a very rude , vindictive response from the owner .
1	After the company made a mistake in misquoting our fare , they were then unwilling to compromise on a price and charged us double the original price given , even after admitting it was their own mistake .
1	After the first stop , we tell the tour guide , Nicholina , that we are unhappy at the back of the van and inform her that we would like to change seats .
1	After waiting on hold for another 10 minutes I hung up and called back .
1	Again , frustratingly , the cruise groups were given a priority and we had to wait .
1	Again no further contact was received .
1	Again this was not the case and we only ended up finding the place when my wife rang and forced the issue .
1	All in all this is a tourist trap .
1	Also , the stops in each city were not adequate .
1	Although they have an elevator , it does not go to the upper observation level .
1	And a Korean tourist group formed a human wall to block off the best photo location until they can take pictures one by one .
1	And if you ask questions and react to the fact that you paid a return ticket for going down as well you are being told you are ridiculous and if you want to o back to the city you need to walk .
1	And she has still not established a fair and flexible seating policy that does not unfairly penalize people for the minivan pickup order that they have no control over .
1	And you need to pay extra money for the waterfall so I won ’ t give a higher rate of the tour because of the it .
1	Anyway 45 mins later with an extremely anxious wife the taxi turned up .
1	Apart from the schedule , the guide of the whole trip is really bad .
1	Apparently they ’ ve been jacking up the prices every year .
1	As a result of the no show , we missed our flight from Geneva and had to buy seats on a later flight .
1	As a result of using this service , I almost missed my flight .
1	As a side note , there was an issue with the seatbelts on the mini bus .
1	As everything else in Dubrovnik the cable car is crazy expensive ( and I live in Paris — used to very high prices ) .
1	As of this writing , Nicholina has not made amends .
