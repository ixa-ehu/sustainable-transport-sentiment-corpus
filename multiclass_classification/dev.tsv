1	Found this to be extortionately priced for what it actually was .
1	Fourth time answered , but left on hold for ages .
1	From the city walls you see virtually the same things so it is not worth the 87 Kruna to go up there !
1	Front row of 4-5 people got a view , the rest were just squeezed in .
1	Gave me one price online .
1	Go elsewhere in Croatia and it 's much cheaper .
1	Go only if you have to and can not help yourself .
1	Got into an argument with the agent on the phone who claimed I would not miss my flight despite 1hr late pickup time - that is for ME to decide , not them !
1	Got off the ferry , there was no person waiting to pick up .
1	Got to the waterfall , tour guide said we have only 30 mins .
1	Had it not been for the cost you would have got 4-5 * , rip tourists off and you get 1 * .
1	Had to make alternative arrangements , which cost us more money .
1	I am of the view that it is just too far to travel in one day to make this a worthwhile trip , especially when you take into account the issues at the Bosnian border .
1	He also blamed the traffic .
1	He drove without stopping and charged me 300 Kuna : that is around £37 , which is about 50 Kuna per kilometre .
1	He got irate and hung up on them .
1	He refused to apologise .
1	He then got totally lost in the centre of Geneva and we could not communicate with him .
1	He was rude and surly and as we sat in bumper to bumper traffic he even had the nerve to blame me : " If you wanted to be on time you should have booked a local taxi and not someone who had to drive from Zadar to collect you " .
1	Horrible company , do not use them .
1	Horrible experience .
1	Horrible rude staff and acted like goons .
1	However , she was not professional - we noticed her rolling her eyes at the requests of some tourists .
1	However , there was a miscommunication on the meeting spot .
1	However , they did not communicate this sufficiently and people were left still purchasing tickets and queuing .
1	However , this was a real disappointment .
1	However , we were refused tickets because the operators decided to shut down the ticketing computers several hours early .
1	However on arrival the child seat wasnt fixed to the car .
1	However this got boring rather quick , as the speaker was very repetitive with what she was saying .
1	However when I asked about a refund ( as we are only here for 1 day ) I was told it was " Hard luck " .
1	Huge rip-off for what it is .
1	Hugely overpriced non event .
1	I disappointed the trip was not as described here on TripAdvisor .
1	I accepted grudgingly , could not be bothered to argue .
1	I am 5 months pregnant and by the time we got to the waterfall at 12.30 my back was in bits after 4 hours on the bus .
1	I am also uploading the rude driver photo for reference .

4	Absolutely spectacular views of Dubrovnik from up here , however our trip was somewhat tarnished by a very large tour group who seemed to constantly push their way around / in front of everyone which was very irritating .
4	There is a nice cafe and they do not charge too much to have a coffee and just look at the city and sea .
4	We took the cable car up once the fog had burned off and the view was amazing .
4	It 's not cheap but it 's beautiful .
4	Great views and worth a visit although the queues was a little tiresome ( however that 's to be expected in the middle of August ) .
4	The views from the top are absolutely breathtaking but consider ordering an Uber to get you up there for a fraction of the cost .
4	A bit of a must-do when visiting Dubrovnik and the novelty of the cable car makes it an ‘ experience ’ .
4	The view over the old town is really good .
4	There is also a war museum at the top and a restaurant .
4	The cable car worked efficiently .
4	Well worth a visit and make sure you take your camera as the views from the top are simply stunning . 94 kuna return ticket for an adult is just about right and its one of those attractions you simply must do .

4	The fare is reasonable and there were no queues .

4	So we turned left and took 50 minutes to go down this not so steep but steady zig zag path .

3	This not cheap but the views from the top are exceptional and give a wonderful perspective of the town itself .
3	Be careful because it can be a nippy on the top especially in the evening
3	Like all cable cars , once you get to the top , the major attraction is the view .

3	A great - if not exactly cheap - way to reach one of the most stunning views in Europe .
3	Cable car up makes it easy and the views are spectacular as is the lovely restaurant at the top .
3	Toddler went for apple juice with ice and was very happy with her drink selection !

3	Give yourself time to sit up there and enjoy the magnificent views over Dubrovnik , the ocean and inland toward Bosnia and along toward Montenegro .

3	We had a coffee & shared a sandwich with chips mainly because we wanted to sit and admire the panoramic view .

3	My original plan was to take the cable car up and walk the path back down but I just ran out of time .
3	We also visited the museum at the top detailing the brave people of the Old Town and the few who kept Mount Srd free
3	Food was good as was service and reasonably priced considering location .
3	There was a fairly long queue but fortunately it moves at a decent pace .
3	To be honest , I would recommend visiting the top by other means ... You can get a tuk-tuk tour in the evening which takes you there at sunset , for e...
3	Once up there do spend time visiting the museum of the Serbo-Croatian war - it will enrich your experience and they deserve all the help they can get ...
3	At 108 Kuna each it is not cheap but it is definitely best after 6pm when the tour party hoards have left the city .
3	Good choice of meals at the restaurant on the top .
3	We ate at the restaurant at the top and it was some of the best food of my life !
3	You can just enjoy a drink , but would recommend making a reservation at busy times if you want lunch or dinner however .
3	Busy Dubrovnik cable cars go up and down a very steep incline providing a great view of the surrounding area .
3	We done the city walls and felt the views and experience there were better .
3	The view from the top is naturally beautiful .
3	We visited during sunset and it was wonderful , pretty crowded though .
3	We walked up to the Cable Car which I would highly recommend , great footpath although trainers is advisable .
3	We ate in the cafe there , outside , really fab .
3	My wife thought the ~ $30 was way too much to ride up a cable car and take some pictures , but I thought it was worth it .
2	It 's a very short , very expensive ride .
2	I would skip it if I had known .
2	It was very expensive to use the cable car and when you get to the top the views are certainly excellent but it does not take long to take it all in ....
2	There is a restaurant if you want to stay longer and I guess that would make it more worthwhile , but of course at an extra price .
2	I personally thought it was overpriced for what it was . 149.00 kunas .
2	The queues to get up and down were horrendous ! !
2	When you got to the top it also cost another 30 kunas to get In the fort .
2	It was good to see the old town from the highest point but the gift shop is disappointing and the cable car only runs every 30 mins .
2	I would not bother with it unless the price goes down .
2	It was 96 kuna per adult which was a lot to go up a hill and back down .
2	The cables from the cable car also are in every picture , detracting from the aesthetics .
2	Nice view over the old town and into neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina , but you get as good a view driving in or strolling up a hill in town , and a...
2	Unfortunately this is a must-do .
2	The view is great but the cable car ride is purely functional - it ’ s over in around four minutes .
2	You could walk up the steep hill but with 32 degrees heat , and kids , you won ’ t enjoy it .
2	At around £2 - £3 per minute ride , this is on par with a fairground ride without any thrills .
2	It is too high for a short ride . 130 HRK adult return , 80 HRK adult one way , 60 HRK for child above 4-yr .
2	Had I knew this , I would have taken a taxi which would have been cheaper for the family .
2	But the cable car price is a big con .
2	What I am getting at is no matter where you stand or view the city the cables that bring the cars up obscure every single view .
2	I do not know who the idiot was who thought it was a good idea to design the cable car so the old city was one side of the cables and the viewing plat...
2	Its not even an interesting ride u , the car moves quickly and about 4 people in a full car can see anything but then again those damn cables are in e...
2	This added nothing to any impression I had of Dubrovnik , the walk around the city walls was a much better way to see over the old city .
2	The museum at the top wasn ’ t even included an at almost £20per person !
2	Ok , so get a good view ...... but at a hell of a price !
2	Really feel this was tourism exploitation .
2	Took cable car to top of Dubrovnik .
2	This was not to exciting .
2	Not much extra to see or experience that you can not see from the city and walls .
2	The view from the top is mainly obstructed by the cable car towers and wires unless you are prepared to climb onto the rocks .
2	There are so many people up there that it 's almost impossible to get a good picture .
2	We wanted to have a drink at the top and the restaurant staff are only really interested in the people dining !
2	The queue to get down was also very long !
2	This was not worth the money !
2	tourist trap , i think this is over priced for what it is , sure you get nice views from the top but its over priced and there is nothing once you are...
2	There are not much things on the top , just a small restaurant is all .
