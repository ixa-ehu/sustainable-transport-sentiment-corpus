NEGATIVE	 i just can give 1 star !
NEGATIVE	a crumby souveneir shop and an expensive cafe / restaurant, not worth the price and time .
NEGATIVE	a disappointment. 
NEGATIVE	A disaster, we were approached on main promenade in the afternoon with Tuk Tuk driver .
NEGATIVE	A horror story .
NEGATIVE	A really disappointing start to the holiday .
NEGATIVE	After 16 hours of travel , it was irritating to say the least .
NEGATIVE	After having trouble locating the pick up site , we were off .
NEGATIVE	Also be aware that there are a lot of refugee pick pockets in the area .
NEGATIVE	Also had a very limited English .
NEGATIVE	Also if you are late by 2mins , your tour guide may scold you for lateness as ours did !
NEGATIVE	Also one hour stop in a small town of Ston is too long as not much to do there .
NEGATIVE	As it was , we spent the next hour and twenty minutes in a car with an angry man who could not wait to get rid of us !
NEGATIVE	at just under å£18 per person for a return trip lasting approx no more than 3 minutes each way it is nothing short of daylight robbery .
NEGATIVE	Avoid it unless you are desperate for photos .
NEGATIVE	Be careful not to become trapped .
NEGATIVE	Being a 25 year old woman alone at the point of questioning and being ushered into a room was extremely intimidating and I was told to ‰ÛÏ ask the people on shore if they ‰Ûª ll give you some money back maybe ‰Û and that was all .
NEGATIVE	Bus took us to Old Town after 25 min wait where we were supposed to have 1.5hrs .
NEGATIVE	But 140 kuna is robbery .
NEGATIVE	But that was not really the cable car peoples fault .
NEGATIVE	By this time the second car had descended , however , another 10 minutes passed before the ticket office opened .
NEGATIVE	Cable car operators should take extreme interest in who they have selling their attraction .
NEGATIVE	Called med one day before departure to tell me that it costed 26 euros more .
NEGATIVE	Called the helpline to CONFIRM the price which was approved by customer services .
NEGATIVE	Called their office 3 times and they kept saying driver was on the way in 3 mins .
NEGATIVE	Can get as good a view from the highway .
NEGATIVE	Disappointing tour with guide Diego who seems to be very unqualified & lacking any tour guide skills .
NEGATIVE	Driving too fast and we did not feel safe .
NEGATIVE	Even there was heavy traffic on the road the driver declined to take the highway route ( it is probably cheaper this way ) and wasn ‰Ûª t really talkative .
NEGATIVE	Even though I did not use the service ( because they were late ) , you need to make sure to have a plan B in Montenegro .
NEGATIVE	Even though we started out at 9am , it was hot and stuffy in the cable car .
NEGATIVE	EVERY bus / transfer / etc is late and crossing the border can be very long .
NEGATIVE	Everything they confirmed in their emails were lies .
NEGATIVE	expensive and not worth the effort do the walls instead this is just a waste of time It is your standard tourist trap.
NEGATIVE	Expensive restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	Firstly they are more expensive .
NEGATIVE	Firstly told by Dino it would cost approx 200-250 Kuna ‰Ûª s although we thought this was a bit pricey he advised us that the meter would be on .
NEGATIVE	For a 4hr trip to Montenegro we spent 8hrs on the bus , not worth it .
NEGATIVE	For older people was a big issue with this since it was dark and there were a lot of steps / terrain .
NEGATIVE	Guide did not seem knowledgeable to share history .
POSITIVE	Had lunch in the panoramic restaurant service was great and lunch was lovely so relaxing !
POSITIVE	Half the joy is the journey getting to the cable car .
POSITIVE	Have a beer or glass of wine at the top and soak up the sunshine and beautiful views !
POSITIVE	Have a couple of coffee and dessert and enjoy the view slowly .
POSITIVE	Having bought a ticket we only had to wait approx 5 mins and in the height of tourist season is great .
POSITIVE	Having visited the walls last time and now the cable car , I would definitely recommend visiting the walls first then the cable car which gives a wider perspective and is even more stunning .
NEGATIVE	He even did not announce an itinerary & his very rare comments were inconsistent & sketchy .
NEGATIVE	He tried to be friendly the rest of the trip to old town , but honestly we had already had a bad experience .
POSITIVE	Highly Recommend , but get there early !
POSITIVE	Homelands War exhibition just behind the top station was interesting and moving .
NEGATIVE	However , like most things in Dubrovnik , the cable car feels overpriced - but in that special way that makes you feel stupid , like you are being messed with .
POSITIVE	However you do it , this is a must see !
POSITIVE	I ‰Ûª m happy the cable car ride was the first experience we did ( it was followed by a walking tour of the Old City and ended with a walk along the city walls ) .
POSITIVE	I am but the ride was smooth and quick !
POSITIVE	I am not great with heights but felt reassured and safe during the quick ride up to the top .
NEGATIVE	I booked a taxi with this company as they had good reviews but I was very disappointed with the service and value for money .
NEGATIVE	I cant say driver was no polite and he also spoke excellent English , but overall I would not recommend it as we just waited that it is done .
POSITIVE	I did not get the opportunity to do this the last time I visited Dubrovnik , so we had to do it this time around !
NEGATIVE	I didn ‰Ûª t really feel safe there .
NEGATIVE	I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE SIRS BECAUSE THE FEELING OF BEING IMPOSTORS WE WILL NEVER FORGET .
NEGATIVE	I do not think I will use this company again .
POSITIVE	I do not usually use cable cars but was glad I decided to travel on this one .
POSITIVE	I enjoyed the museum and cafe at the top aswell .
NEGATIVE	I feel this attraction is grossly overpriced when we ended up taking a uber ride to the top of fort Lawrence for 25 pounds and saw the same views .
POSITIVE	I had the best risotto with scampi in a long time , and some great homemade icecream for a dessert .
NEGATIVE	I hated it .
POSITIVE	I have seen more expensive ones .
POSITIVE	I highly recommend going up , but do so right before sunset .
POSITIVE	I particularly enjoyed walking out on the hills beyond the war museum .
POSITIVE	I really loved it .
NEGATIVE	I unfortunately gave them the benefit of the doubt and booked with them again in September .
NEGATIVE	I used it few times and often they was dirty , driver was slpooy and cars are old and no comfortable.
NEGATIVE	I used this company as I thought it had good reviews , little did I know what I was getting into .
NEGATIVE	I waited 20 minutes for the tour bus outside my hostel ( the location I had indicated at time of booking ) .
NEGATIVE	I waited over 40 minutes on the top for the return ride , and we did not receive any information how long we should wait .
NEGATIVE	I wanted to book a transfer from the Airport Innsbruck to Mayrhofen for my friend and me , in case of that we both was looking in the internet for a transfer for us my friend who was in the uk told me the price to mayrhofen it was showing to him more expensive than to me at the same time we was phon.
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed that we did not learn all that much during the tour .
NEGATIVE	I was horrified at their customer service .
NEGATIVE	I was not offered a reschedule or even my money back .
NEGATIVE	I was presented with two options : 1 ) take the new fare or 2 ) cancel the booking .
NEGATIVE	I was really disappointed that the agency scheduled the trip without consulting the weather forecast , but above all by the fact that they left the whole group under a thunder for more than three hours .
NEGATIVE	I was shocked with how long it took the get there as it only took 3 hours to get home .
NEGATIVE	I was still confused why it was higher and a day later received another email titled URGENT asking if I was happy to accept the new amount of 113 EURO .
POSITIVE	I was there on a busy race weekend , and waited only about 10 minutes for a cable car .
NEGATIVE	I was told I could not go back up without paying the full fare .
NEGATIVE	I was told the driver was not coming and we were going to have to sort it out ourselves .
NEGATIVE	I were among the first 50 in the queue but after waiting for 1.5 hours I still found myself lining up waiting for the mini vans .
NEGATIVE	I will certainly not use this company again and will certainly not be recommending them to anyone else .
NEGATIVE	I will most certainly be telling friends and colleagues not to use it but rather get a bit of exercise and walk up Srd .
NEGATIVE	i will never enter that kind of cable car again .
NEGATIVE	I will never use this company again .
NEGATIVE	I will say no more .
NEGATIVE	I wonder why the company didn ‰Ûª t contact me to inform me that we had to wait a bit ?
NEGATIVE	I wonder why the company waited nearly 1 hour to inform me , and when they did , they told me that he was 15 minutes delayed , and not half an hour ?
POSITIVE	I would also suggest visiting the restaurant at the top with the sea view .
NEGATIVE	I would be extremely cautious .
NEGATIVE	I would certainly not recommend this company .
NEGATIVE	I would definitely not be using this company again and would not recommend .
NEGATIVE	I would have cancelled if it was not for the fact that the transfer was about 12 hours away and there was no way of organising a different one .
POSITIVE	I would highly recomend anyone visiting Dubrovnik t use the cable car .
NEGATIVE	I would never again book with Select Dubrovnik as they do not have the tourists ' best interest in mind .
NEGATIVE	I would never use them again , I never want to feel as helpless as that day and can not trust they will stick to their word regardless of when you book or how much you pay .
NEGATIVE	I would not do this over that 's for sure .
NEGATIVE	I would not recommend this tour .
NEGATIVE	I would not recommend this trip for anyone who can not walk far
NEGATIVE	I would not recommend traveling with this company .
NEGATIVE	I would not trust this company as they are very unreliable and do not take the safety of their passengers seriously .
NEGATIVE	I would say skip the cable cars .
NEGATIVE	I would skip this , it 's not really worth the price .
POSITIVE	I would strongly encourage hiking to the top !
NEGATIVE	I would urge prospective clients to find another tour operator besides SuperTours / Viator , as they provide rather poor customer service .
NEGATIVE	If he was there , he should have contacted the hotel staff about our whereabouts .
NEGATIVE	If I had not have phoned , 8 people would have been left at Corfu airport .
POSITIVE	If in Dubrovnik , do not miss it .
NEGATIVE	If not perhaps Conecto should not accept the booking or the money .
POSITIVE	If possible , come here before the sunset and you get a even more beautiful sunset view !
NEGATIVE	If that ‰Ûª s true it is very risky to go in their cars .
POSITIVE	If the weather is clear at the top , take this 4-minute cable car ride to the top for a stunning panoramic view .
NEGATIVE	If they owe money , admit it and will not pay , then it is theft .
NEGATIVE	If this is how they treat potential new customers I can not believe there is still a business to run !
NEGATIVE	If we were to go back we definitely wouldn ‰Ûª t bother with this again .
NEGATIVE	IF YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PEACE , DO NOT CONTACT THEM .
POSITIVE	If you are feeling afluent the restaurant looked lovely .
POSITIVE	If you are in Dubrovnick , you must take the cable car - the view was simply amazing .
NEGATIVE	If you are really desperate to go to the top ( where there is very little to see anyway apart from a good view , an exorbitant cafe and shop , and a museum about the war ) then do it, otherwise , ughhh give it a miss.
POSITIVE	If you book the cable car ride by itself , you can spend as much time on Mt.Srd as you like .
POSITIVE	If you can bring a bottle of wine and just enjoy the time .
POSITIVE	If you choose a clear day you will experience stunning views of the old town and surrounding area .
NEGATIVE	If you decide to visit Montenegro , it is quite beautiful , but I would think twice before taking this tour , this guide , or Magical Tours .
POSITIVE	If you do not have time for anything else , take the cable car and see the wonderful area that is Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	If you do not want to get ripped-off again though you will have to stand behind other tourists cramming to get pictures next to a gigantic cross .
POSITIVE	If you do one thing do this ride as the views from the top are amazing on a good day .
POSITIVE	If you go to OldTownDubrovnik , do not miss taking the cable car .
NEGATIVE	If you have an adequate fitness level you can walk up and down to avoid the cost .
NEGATIVE	If you have mobility issues , especially a wheelchair , do not waste your money .
POSITIVE	If you have time , relax over drinks and lunch at the outdoor restaurant .
POSITIVE	If you have time , stop in to the Museum at the top , great views from its roof .
POSITIVE	If you have time take one way ticket it is cheaper and going down on foot ( ( takes about 30 min ) is very nice walk . 
NEGATIVE	If you only have 2-3 hours for the inner city , do not risk loosing time with the cable car .
POSITIVE	If you organised yourself I am sure you could enjoy several hours along the ridge - maybe even walk down .
NEGATIVE	If you suffer from claustrophobia I would not recommend this ride , I do not but still found it very uncomfortable .
POSITIVE	If you take photos , you have to go .
NEGATIVE	If you travel in high season there might be long queues at the bottom station of the cable car .
POSITIVE	If you want to have a fantastic , unobstructed view of Dubrovnik , old town and the surrounding areas , do not miss taking the cable up the hill behind the old town .
NEGATIVE	If you want to spend a tenner to travel for a few minutes up to an overpriced dusty dump on a hill then this is for you .
NEGATIVE	Important , please avoid my disheartening experience and possibly others , with the company Connect to Transfer , I booked a return trip on11th Dec 2017 from Hannover Airport to Bielefeld , on the 10th December KLM cancelled my return flight , immediately I called Croatia ( Connect to Transfer ) can...
POSITIVE	Impressive view of the OldTown , the sea and certain parts of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	In 2015 drivers seem to have been replaced by non-locals who can not speak the language but more interestingly,do not know the area and routes .
NEGATIVE	In addition , I lost my passport in the post office in Mostar , what they did is to leave me in an unknown small town and ask you to do everything by yourself .
NEGATIVE	In addition she never bothered to let anyone know where restrooms were , or places for drinks / snacks / atm ‰Ûª s at rest stops .
POSITIVE	In case of Dubrovnik , this is the best thing to do ( of course you should visit the city wall ) .
NEGATIVE	In case you decide to ever go and try the Dubrovnik Cable Car be sure to check and over check the latest timetable so you do not end up like us walking for 1 hour in complete darkness on a small road full of stones and gravel .
NEGATIVE	In Kator , we were teamed up with a lousy tour guide girl who did not mention anything more than we already knew from the bus and it left us with no tie to explore the city and walking up to the chapel on the hill - the bus guide misinformed us telling us we would have enough time .
NEGATIVE	In order to avoid booking those big coach tour which usually takes 2-3 hrs at Montenegro border control , I even sent a message to SelectDubrovnik to double confirm that I am booking the correct tour - the 18persons minibus tour .
NEGATIVE	In other places even if there were uncontrollable " technical problems " the operator would have sent buses to take their stranded customers down the hill but this operator showed no consideration whatsoever for the people they stranded .
NEGATIVE	In summary , please be aware that any legitimate changes you wish to make to your journey may lead to the loss of your deposit .
NEGATIVE	In the end I had to call a different company to rush us to the airport and pay again even though I had paid a deposit to Connecto .
NEGATIVE	In the end there were troubles , few girls from our group were missing and we had to wait over an hour .
NEGATIVE	in the end we decided to wait in a bar and we didn ‰Ûª t even see the waterfalls
NEGATIVE	In the winter departure time is not 16 : 00 PM , it is 15 : 30 !
POSITIVE	Incredible views of the whole of Dubrovnik , definitely worth the money for the return trip .
POSITIVE	Inexpensive and alotof fun .
NEGATIVE	Inside , it is dark due to heavy tinted windows and can be claustrophobic as the vehicle is filled to capacity .
NEGATIVE	Instead of aplogising , the compnay tried to use our card again .
NEGATIVE	Instead they just ripped us off and took our money .
POSITIVE	Instead we just had a drink and soaked up the views and atmosphere .

POSITIVE	It 's beautiful  .
POSITIVE	It 's eerie like you are in a ceasefire , and the war could start any moment and well worth the small entry fee .
POSITIVE	It 's expensive but it 's well worth it .
POSITIVE	It 's newly reopened after being destroyed in the war and it 's well worth a visit .
POSITIVE	It 's not cheap to take the cable car ( about å£15 ) but it is well worth it as the views from the top are fantastic - you can see not just the Old Town , but the whole Dubrovnik area , including the Babin Kuk area , Lapad , and all the little islands fading into the distance .
POSITIVE	It 's now a museum and worth checking out .
POSITIVE	It 's pricey but well worth the spend .
POSITIVE	It 's quite expensive to take the cable car and there can be long queues at peak times but it 's well worth it .
NEGATIVE	It 's simply not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	It 's tight , people smell and you will not be able to see nothing anyways as they pack it to the brim .
POSITIVE	It 's well worth the money and as a special treat , have something to eat or a coffee and cake in the restaurant , you will not be disappointed .
POSITIVE	It 's worth it though , a quick ride to the summit for a fantastic view .
NEGATIVE	It ‰Ûª s a mid evil city with a wall on the coast .
NEGATIVE	it ‰Ûª s massively overpriced for a trip up the mountain .
POSITIVE	It also gives you great perspective of the numerous islands off the coast .
POSITIVE	It costs 140,00 kn for an adult round trip but definitely worth the money .
POSITIVE	It costs 96 kuna and is good value .
NEGATIVE	It costs A LOT .
NEGATIVE	It did not look like he was trying to pass a car as we did not accelerate and we nearly went head on into an oncoming car .
NEGATIVE	It does not deserve the money it costs .
POSITIVE	It gets you up MountSrdj and back down again with good views of the OldTown .
POSITIVE	It gives you a sense of how truly special the walled city and sea views really are .
POSITIVE	It goes without saying the views are unparalleled .
NEGATIVE	It has been 30 working days since the incident and despite continuous e-mails , I have still not received the money and now they are not responding to my e-mails .
POSITIVE	It is a beautiful view and if your organised you could book a table at the restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	It is a bit pricey , but worth it for the spectacular views .
NEGATIVE	It is a danger break so that we could not use the buggy furthermore .
POSITIVE	It is a must , just beautiful views .
POSITIVE	It is a rather quick ride up , and a wonderful photo and video opportunity !
POSITIVE	It is a reasonably short ride but certainly worthwhile doing !
NEGATIVE	It is a row of four seats cramped next to each other , where only two seats are free for my friend and I. 
POSITIVE	It is a smooth cable car ride because this is not a place of particularly strong winds .
NEGATIVE	It is a tool simply to fleece the cruise ship passengers who spend a few hours in the city .
POSITIVE	It is a very short ride , but you can stay at the viewing level as long as you want .
NEGATIVE	It is a waste of time and money .
POSITIVE	It is a wonderful view but it does not take long to see .
POSITIVE	It is also a must do experience as you will get the chance to see all Dubrovnik from a great location .
POSITIVE	It is an exceptional feet of engineering .
POSITIVE	It is at the side of a busy highway and the steps up to the highway from Pile is the most intense part .
NEGATIVE	It is bad for Croatia to treat visitors like this .
NEGATIVE	It is badly run and expensive for what it is .
NEGATIVE	It is even inhumane , if it was happening in my city I would definitely find / direct an alternative , and pay the excess amount , and never let my customers down early morning , before dawn .
POSITIVE	It is even more beautiful in the evening with all the lights on .
NEGATIVE	It is less than 3 minute ride and it is the most expensive cable car I have ever used
POSITIVE	It is less than four minutes but provides the best views anywhere .
NEGATIVE	It is neither ethical nor responsible .
POSITIVE	It is not a cheap attraction ( as everything else in Dubrovnik , onde of the most expensive cities I have ever been to ) , but it is worth it .

NEGATIVE	It is very expensive for such a short ride and if you are not at the front of the queue , you might not even get the best views .
POSITIVE	It is worth it and the souvenir shop is nice .
NEGATIVE	It lasted a few minutes and when it was over I wish I had not walked all the way up to the cable cars ( it 's quite a long walk ) .
POSITIVE	It literally the most beautiful , piercing sunset you will see in your life !
POSITIVE	It literally the most beautiful , piercing sunset you will see in your life !
NEGATIVE	It looked so different and I was expecting the cable car to take us all around the city however it really was a disappointment .
NEGATIVE	It looks like you can walk down a few hundred stairs and be back in Old Town , but that 's not the case .
POSITIVE	It made the view even more interesting .
NEGATIVE	It meant we had less time in Kotor Bay which was disappointing .
POSITIVE	It must be the best place to enjoy the panorama of Dubrovnik Old Town .
NEGATIVE	It opens at 9 am , we got there 8.50 and there was already a long queue standing in the already baking sun .

NEGATIVE	It was a mistake !
NEGATIVE	It was a shame to have been in Mostar and not having had at least one hour free to travel .
POSITIVE	It was a smooth ride up .
NEGATIVE	It was a total waste of money IMO .
NEGATIVE	It was also a 4 hour drive and was never offered to stop or any conversation for that matter .
POSITIVE	It was also perfect that my mom could sit down to have a drink while my boyfriend and I wandered around a bit to take photos .
NEGATIVE	It was an absolute harsh mistake , totally regretful about having done this .
POSITIVE	It was an experience for a life , we Experienced the city in the most beautiful way .
NEGATIVE	It was an extra cost and stress not needed .
POSITIVE	it was better !
NEGATIVE	It was bloody awful .
POSITIVE	It was expensive - å£20 for 1 adult and 1 child , but the views were truly worth it .
POSITIVE	It was great and serene .
NEGATIVE	It was late in the dark at nearly 7pm and 200 + people were stuck uphill in the dark lining in queue for hours to wait for some mini vans that could only take 6-7 persons each ride to take us down hill .
NEGATIVE	It was mediocre , service was below standards and we were left with 20 mins of running to the budva city and back ... did we take the tour to explore Montenegro or eat ?
POSITIVE	It was nice to walk around the back for a little space from the crowds and a nice look at the mountains behind the city .
NEGATIVE	It was not as expected and we were disappointed .
NEGATIVE	it was not working when we were traveling .
NEGATIVE	It was quite confusing .

POSITIVE	It was short journey but definitely view is great ( panoramic ) .
POSITIVE	It was so so so worth it .
POSITIVE	It was such a nice day out expecially when the suns out .
POSITIVE	It was totally worth the wait .
NEGATIVE	It was very disappointing that having asked the tour organisers about Budva we were given incorrect information .
NEGATIVE	It was very disorganized , we ended up at a mall and lost our 2 hours in Kotor .
NEGATIVE	It was way too hot and boring to recommend anyone to see .
POSITIVE	It was well worth it - the ride is smooth and the views are stunning .
POSITIVE	it was well worth the money , at the top you get great views of the old town , sit and have a Coffey or a beer and admire the view  .
POSITIVE	It will give you super view over the city .
NEGATIVE	it would be scary ! 
NEGATIVE	It would not have been so bad if he had given a simple apology , after all delays can happen .
NEGATIVE	its a 2 minute ride that costs 30 euros for 2 people back and forth , offers nothing amazing view wise , and its a bad photo op since the cables are in the way all the time .
POSITIVE	Its a former battle site from 1991 and I found some shrapnel - a proper , cracking souvenir .
POSITIVE	Its expensive for just the cable car , but if you take the time , have a meal at the top and just soak in the sights its well worth it .
POSITIVE	Its not often you get a wonderful seascape on one side , impressive mountain views on the other and a great view of the unique OldTownofDubrovnik and the surrounding area aswell .

NEGATIVE	JUST stay away from SelectDubrovnik if u dont want your vacation ruined .
POSITIVE	Just take a walk up there and you can take the most beautiful panoramas , group photos and selfies with a lovely sunset in the background .
POSITIVE	Kids loved it too  .
POSITIVE	Last minute decision on the way back to my apartment late one afternoon and found it v quiet .
NEGATIVE	Lastly company instead of helping us to compensate for the amount we paid is also not willing to refund the initial amount which was being charged to us , which shows clear intention of cheating clients by taking money in advance and not giving them services
NEGATIVE	Later in budva , she ' recommended ' a restaurant that she said was fast and best of town - WRONG !
NEGATIVE	Let down is an understatement .
NEGATIVE	Lift in the upper building is not working or permanently occupied by staff so you are limited to the arrival level .
NEGATIVE	Like most touristy things in Dubrovnik , it is overpriced and nothing special .
POSITIVE	Little bit of an uphill walk to the station BUTI assure you worth it for the stunning views as you travel of the old town , out to sea and the islands beyond .

POSITIVE	Lucky that in this time of year is not busy so we had hill just for us , also great war museum worth visiting on the hill !
POSITIVE	Lunch in the cafe enjoying the sensational view was fantastic .
NEGATIVE	Magical Tours and our Tour Guide were abysmal .
POSITIVE	Make sure you get a really sunny day to get the great views and photos .
POSITIVE	Marvellous cafe at the top and the view down on to the city is absolutely stunning .
POSITIVE	Marvellous views across the Old town .
NEGATIVE	Massive queues at times .
NEGATIVE	More of an opportunity to take a picture from the top of the walls and ocean but , you can do this as you are leaving Dubrovnik as well .
NEGATIVE	Moreover , the price is very expensive ( 25‰âÂ/person ) and there is nothing to do in the top ( excluding a 4x4 offroad rides , if you are able to pay a lot ) .
POSITIVE	Morning is best for photographs but dinner and a sunset are equally enticing .
NEGATIVE	Most of the other tour guests were also suddenly told they would not be dropped off at the Pile Gate and were instead left at the cable car stop .
NEGATIVE	Much too pricey for two of us leta alone if you have children with you .
POSITIVE	Must do and see in Dubrovnik forsure !
POSITIVE	must do if you visit  .
POSITIVE	Must do whilst in the city !
POSITIVE	My 5 year old loved the cable car and the view is spectacular .
NEGATIVE	My advice is not to use them because it seems one could allege that there is a lack of integrity within their business .
POSITIVE	My elderly mother was traveling with us , and being able to go to the top with such stunning views was one of the highlights of our trip .
POSITIVE	My experience with DubrovnikCableCar was exhilarating !
POSITIVE	My husband enjoyed looking down on things asusual  .
NEGATIVE	My husband instantly blocked his card .
NEGATIVE	My parents took a view and said it not for them .
POSITIVE	My partner and I took the cable car up to have a nice dinner at the top .
NEGATIVE	My partner and I went on this day tour today and found the conduct of our tour guide to be rude and combatative from the beginning of our trip .
NEGATIVE	My partner and I were really looking forward to this but were left bitterly disappointed .
NEGATIVE	My personal opinion is that you should skip the top of the hill and spend your money on other aspects of dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	My review is based on next facts : - wife bought for whole family ( 4 pax ) as a surprise tour over the Viator for 182 $ ( around 160 EUR ) while later we found out that same package is sold on their website for 120 EUR - this is not old FORD car , this is cheap replica that every second of the tour.
NEGATIVE	My seatbelt was not working properly and this was the same for my husband and the lady sat next to me .
NEGATIVE	My wife was very upset and doubt whether we were discriminated as we are Asian .
NEGATIVE	name of driver was Michael, I would not reccommend this transfer agency .
NEGATIVE	Needed to get a taxi from city centre to Panarama Restaurant and as cable car not working we needed to get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	Needless to say , our day was canceled .
POSITIVE	Needless to say , the swift cable car ride to the top is a pleasant change , and the fortress has been wonderfully revived as a museum and restaurant that give you amazing views down over the orange tiled roofs of the old city .
NEGATIVE	Needless to say due to the fact we were not given ANY prior notice our transfer was not turning up we missed our flight and had to wait 6 HOURS at the airport for the next flight .

NEGATIVE	On our visit we were told that the queue would only take 20 minutes , but people at the front told us they were waiting more than an hour .

POSITIVE	One of the best places to get a great photo of the OldCity -- and a selfie !
POSITIVE	one posing for photos !
NEGATIVE	Only 2 cars and they were overcrowded .
NEGATIVE	Only if you are a photo freak you should spend so much to make a 3m up and down ride, the distance covered os too short and nothing special to offer !
NEGATIVE	Only on checking with our back we realised the full money was not refunded and only on then asking the company they started mentioning cancellation charges !
NEGATIVE	Operator was very rude and incosiderate to how the passengers would return back to the start point .
POSITIVE	Order a bottle of good wine and watch the day turn into night and enjoy a view of the city lights .
POSITIVE	Our cable car was busy but views from the top were worth it !
NEGATIVE	Our car was not as we booked - we had booked a luxury catagory and we got sent a tiny Renault .
POSITIVE	Our cruise ship came into Dubrovnik , and after walking around this beautiful city , we decided to take the cable car ride up for the breathing panoramic views .
NEGATIVE	Our driver did not provide any info during the trip at all .
NEGATIVE	Our driver was awful, and the driving was unacceptable .
NEGATIVE	Our driver was Russian , spoke NO English or French , not one word .
NEGATIVE	Our guide , Marinara , was not engaging with the group ( such as inviting questions or asking what our interests were ) .
NEGATIVE	Our of curiosity I went online to get another quote and was still quoted the original 92 EURO .
NEGATIVE	Our rental car company fitted our seat properly without me asking so I do not think it is unreasonable .
NEGATIVE	Our tour guide started off by announcing the rules of the trip eg " no talking whilst I am talking " , and " I demand respect ... " .
POSITIVE	Out of all the things to do in Dubrovnik , the cable car seems expensive ‰Û_ but really , it ‰Ûª s so worth it if you have the time .
POSITIVE	Outside the walls by the PloceGate is a station for a high speed cable car gondola that takes you up to the top of SrdHill ( serge ) which offers incredible views of the old city and the surrounding area .
POSITIVE	Over all the view was beautiful and this clear sunny day and well worth the ride up .
NEGATIVE	Over in a jiffy packed in like sardines .
NEGATIVE	Over priced , packed and in my opinion , not worth it !
NEGATIVE	Overall , I feel like I barely saw or learned anything today and was mostly just in a hurry to make the most of my limited time .
NEGATIVE	Overall , If you want to take a tour with a boring guide holding a history lesson , than this tour 100 % suit you .
NEGATIVE	Overall good reviews but my advice is if you need a taxi , hire a car instead .
NEGATIVE	Overall very stressful and inferior service - I certainly would NOT use them again and would NOT recommend !
POSITIVE	Pack a bottle of wine , make sure your cell phone is charged / has space for ample photos , because this will be one of the most beautiful things you have ever seen .
POSITIVE	Panorama Restaurant is good .
NEGATIVE	Pathetic drivers and services .
POSITIVE	Pay the 120kuna , approx å£13 to top and back down , less if you walk down and enjoy the sights .
NEGATIVE	Paying 570kuna ( 85Usd ) for a return trip is just not worth it .
POSITIVE	Personally do not think either the entrance fee or restaurant were over priced at all .
NEGATIVE	Pick up 40 minutes late on both outward and return journeys .
NEGATIVE	Pick up from the apartment ( which had been booked at the same time as airport pick up ) was also late , again I had to cross the road and walk to the aforementioned bakery where the driver was sat on his phone .
NEGATIVE	Pity .
NEGATIVE	Please avoid this company they are unreliable , unprofessional and more importantly dangerous .
NEGATIVE	Please do not do this trip if you are elderly , pregnant or have small children as the amount of time spent on the bus is ridiculous and whilst the falls and Mostar are nice ... you would be better hiring a car and doing this tour at your own pace .
NEGATIVE	Please DO NOT use this company .
NEGATIVE	Please think twice before booking with this company , Connecto Transfers .
POSITIVE	Plenty of different platforms to view Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Plus are two lovely restaurants at the top  .
NEGATIVE	Preordered minivan driver arrived 45 minutes late .
NEGATIVE	Pretty much a scam for me though , only a restaurant on top of the hill .
POSITIVE	Priceless .
POSITIVE	Probably should be the first thing you do in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Probably the best way to view dubrovnik old town , reasonably priced and well worth a visit .
NEGATIVE	Probably the only time we felt ripped off this trip .
POSITIVE	Provides a great perspective and wonderful photo opportunities .
POSITIVE	Provides a reality check on the many post cards purchased that do truely reflect the area .
NEGATIVE	Put simply the cost of the cable car left a sour taste and spoilt the whole experience .

POSITIVE	Quick and easy .

POSITIVE	Really nice to sit and enjoy a coffee while taking in the views .
NEGATIVE	Really think carefully before booking these types of tours .
POSITIVE	Reasonable price aswell .
POSITIVE	Reasonably priced and a one way ticket gives you the opportunity to walk back down .
POSITIVE	Reasonably priced and clean modern cable car Panorama restaurant at the top has the most amazing views of dubrovnik and worth a stay for coffee on the terrace .
POSITIVE	Reconstruction cost $12 billion , and it was worth every penny , and every cent was spent in good taste .
NEGATIVE	Refund promised , but what are the chances ?
POSITIVE	Restaurant is nice aswell .
POSITIVE	Restaurant located outside is pricey but well worth a visit even for a drink and to sit down and take in the stunning scenery .
POSITIVE	Restaurant up at the top where you can have a meal or drinks with great views .
POSITIVE	Ride up the mountain provides an excellent view of the OldTown and the surrounding area .
NEGATIVE	Rip off
POSITIVE	Rode up one evening to capture the sunset and take in the view whilst enjoying a wonderful dinner .
NEGATIVE	Ruined our day and stay in Split .
NEGATIVE	Sadly our driver left a lot to desire for , we were traveling from New York - not carrying euros or Kuna ; therefore I had to make a quick stop to exchange money at the airport , was not given an option to pay prior to arrival Sent my husband to meet the drive.
NEGATIVE	Save your moeny .
NEGATIVE	save your money and spend it on something else
NEGATIVE	Save your money and spend it on the entry fee to the wall .
NEGATIVE	Save yourself stress , time and ALOT of cash and book with someone else .

NEGATIVE	Secondly they are not transparent with their cancellation charges .
POSITIVE	See the luxury yachts anchored in the bay and the old town from above .
POSITIVE	See the old city , the outer city , the many islands and a beautiful Adriatic sea .
NEGATIVE	Seriously this is an overrated place .
POSITIVE	Service is very efficient it appears they run approximately every five minutes .
NEGATIVE	Shame on you guys at connecto-taxi .
NEGATIVE	Shame you n you Conecto
NEGATIVE	She didn ‰Ûª t give anyone her phone number , and her instructions on where to meet or what we were doing were unclear at best .
NEGATIVE	She has not requested other people to change seats .
NEGATIVE	She is horrible, like a history teacher to repeat the information that you can find on the internet .
NEGATIVE	She just repeated " u wait for the next coach " and drove away ( again the " you are none of my business " attitude ) , leaving me and my wife on the road shocked and didnt know what to do .
NEGATIVE	She kept complaining about how much work she had to do to get us through the border .
NEGATIVE	She looked worried and panicked for most of the trip .
NEGATIVE	She rudely told us " you want to go with us or not , if not go and get the refund " , I chose to have my refund because the price and itinerary of the big coach n minibus tours are completely different , and I didnt want to compromise given their rude n careless attitude .
NEGATIVE	She says that , as we took a tour on the same bus the day before and we already knew we would be seated at the back , we should have said something earlier .
NEGATIVE	She says this would not be possible .
NEGATIVE	She then raised her voice and asked me to take my seat , noting that I am just one unhappy customer .
NEGATIVE	She was not pleasant .
NEGATIVE	She was probably getting commission for the guests , so she could not care less about what we saw and visited .
POSITIVE	Short , smooth ride ; not too expensive .
NEGATIVE	Simply appalling .
NEGATIVE	Simply because an incompetent cable car attendant decided it is more intelligent not to make a public announcement that this is the last trip going down .
POSITIVE	Simply breathtaking !
NEGATIVE	Since then they have refused to return my deposit , although 17 hours notice was given , and no costs were incurred as a result , furthermore I forwarded KLM 's cancellation notification , but to no avail .
POSITIVE	Sit at the restaurant , enjoy appetizers and wine and wait to see the sunset .
NEGATIVE	SKIP the Cable Car & Rent a Car or hire a Taxi !
NEGATIVE	Skip this line skip this city .
NEGATIVE	Skip this place
POSITIVE	Smooth ride to the top .
POSITIVE	Smooth travel experience both ways and a great view .
NEGATIVE	So , 5 stars for the view from the top , but I am afraid only 1 star for the greedy money making management .
POSITIVE	So a good start and easy to find .
NEGATIVE	So a lot of money to get a birds eye view of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	So beautiful in so many ways ; P  
NEGATIVE	SO BEWARE   IF YOU BOOK ONLINE AND THEY CANCEL THE CABLE CARS YOU WILL NOT GET ANY KIND OF REFUND ONE VERY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED COUPLE
POSITIVE	So glad we did !
POSITIVE	So good we went twice on different days !
NEGATIVE	So I asked her for the company address for refund and she wasnt even sure whether her company has offices in the old city !

POSITIVE	Spent a wonderful 3 hours up there !
POSITIVE	Staff great and it was a wonderful night  .
POSITIVE	Staff was courteous .
NEGATIVE	Stay away and use another company is my advice .
NEGATIVE	STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY unless all you want is a ride to the top of the mountain and back .
NEGATIVE	Still , no attempt to compensate , negotiate or discount from their ridiculous quote of 213 which was more than it would have cost to book 4 individual taxis !
NEGATIVE	Still nobody showed so we called the office twice once ourselves and once by our hotel .
NEGATIVE	Still waiting for refund .
POSITIVE	Stop and have a drink in the Panorama restaurant to fully appreciate the area .
POSITIVE	Stunning fort imperial with museum highly reccommend .

NEGATIVE	Super long lines to use this cable car and it 's really not worth the money or effort .
POSITIVE	Superb views of city and mountains inland .
POSITIVE	Superb views of the city of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Surely when a transfer is pre booked and the drop off address is given to the company the customer can expect to be dropped at least at a convenient place for the customer .
POSITIVE	Surprisingly there is a less-advertised war museum next to the top station which is really impressive .
POSITIVE	Swallows were swooping through the air over the path and the sun vibrated everything beautifully .

POSITIVE	Terrific restaurant at the top and excellent war museum .
POSITIVE	Terrific views and worth the money .
POSITIVE	Thank goodness the old town was preserved .
NEGATIVE	Thankfully the journey was only about 4 minutes but it was one of the most horrible , smelly , disgusting 4 minutes of my life .
POSITIVE	That 's when the adventure began .
POSITIVE	That 's where the best views were .
NEGATIVE	That is really shameful , as we have to buy a new buggy .
NEGATIVE	That ruined the night , especially when dinner was for my partners 30th birthday .
NEGATIVE	That said , whilst we were in the City the organisation and communication from the people that run the cable car was astonishingly poor .
NEGATIVE	The 2 ladies at bottom of the cable car ( where you purchase your tickets ) were extremely rude to us because it seems we could not read the sign that it was closed ) .
NEGATIVE	The ‰ÛÏ luxury minivan ‰Û is a small vehicle that can accommodate up to 21 adults , including the driver and your guide .
NEGATIVE	The activity cost a lot but was not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	The additional cost and delays to our vacation have been stressful .
NEGATIVE	The air conditioning on the mini bus only works when the bus is moving so this was a very long and warm wait .

NEGATIVE	The bus had already been and decided to leave early and drive to our hotel even though we had been told this was no longer a meeting point .
NEGATIVE	The bus picked us up on time and the driving overall was uneventful , but the a / c had some sort of issue and I was either sweating profusely or freezing for the entire journey .
NEGATIVE	The cable and cars did not look stable enough to ride on .
POSITIVE	The cable car came second only to the OldCityWall walk for me , the ride is quick and reasonably priced and when you get to the top you are afforded some fantastic views of OldTown and the whole of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	The cable car costs $37.00 Canadian for a couple of minutes .
NEGATIVE	The cable car fee of 150 Kuna seems a bit stiff to me .
POSITIVE	The cable car gives a couple of minutes ride up the hill overlooking Dubrovnik and the AdriaticSea .

POSITIVE	The cable car trip is a must do while in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The cable car was a great thing to do .
POSITIVE	the cable car was great fun !
POSITIVE	The cable card was really good and gives the best views over Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	The cable care ride is very short , you need to wait in a long line to get in , it runs in 2 cars , each can take up to 30 people so inside the car you can be crowded actually by people .
POSITIVE	The cable cars run from Ploce district , are regular , fast and reasonably priced .
POSITIVE	The cable takes you to the top of the mountain above Dubrovnik and gives a great view going up and down .
POSITIVE	The cafÌ© has one of the best views in the world .

POSITIVE	The cafe at the top is good for coffee and a snack and of course the views .

POSITIVE	The car itself is air conditioned which was welcomed !
NEGATIVE	the car was absolutely packed , we were like sardines and as I found on the descent it was impossible to see anything .
NEGATIVE	The car was not clean , and when we escaped the traffic driver was driving way above speed limits .
POSITIVE	The cocktail bar at the top has got VERY good looking waiters .
NEGATIVE	The company cancelled my Val D'isere to Geneva Airport transfer with < 2hrs notice , said they could pick me up an hour late which ( with Easter Monday ski resort traffic ) would likely make me miss my flight .
NEGATIVE	The company offered no solution or alternative .
NEGATIVE	The couple in front of us asked the sullen " gatekeeper " why hordes were allowed through when we had been queuing for an hour her answer was " they are a group " !
POSITIVE	The crystal clear sea , the old walled town of Dubrovnik , the islands , and the mountains behind .
POSITIVE	The day we went was clear & spectacular views !
NEGATIVE	The drive from town to Dubrovnik airport was disaster .
NEGATIVE	The driver arrived after half an hour .
NEGATIVE	the driver basically would stop at various places and tell us " 15 minutes " - we were left to our own devices in trying to figure out what we were to look at .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show for this despite us paying the deposit .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show up to collect us , despite having confirmation emails the day before , and we were left stranded .
NEGATIVE	The driver got to the hotel 1 hour late .
NEGATIVE	The driver kept saying it was the parent 's responsibility in croatia for the seat and then proceeded to try to fit the seat incorrectly before I stepped in .
NEGATIVE	The driver phoned the apartment for instructions and was told to take us to Pile gate but he decided not to because the traffic had been bad and he would be late for his next pick up .
NEGATIVE	The driver showed up 11:30 , and he told me that he had informed the company around 10 o'clock that he would be half an hour delayed , and that he asked them to inform me .

NEGATIVE	The driver took us on a route driving quickly on a motor way and the safety of my child was put at risk .
NEGATIVE	The driver was 30 minutes late .
NEGATIVE	the driver was also late in collecting us and we only made our ferry transfer by the skin of our teeth .
NEGATIVE	The driver was late for pickup , which ok , can happen but then 20 minutes late for our return to the airport - no contact made about any delay .
NEGATIVE	The Dubrovnik Cable car is a huge waste of money and better viewpoints can be seen renting a car ( which is also more cost effective if you are traveling a group ) .
NEGATIVE	The entire process was a debacle and previous reviews show they have no concept of customer service .
NEGATIVE	The evening before the transfer ( which was early in the morning ) I get a call from their customer service saying they made a mistake when calculating the fare , and it is actually 160 EUR ( 50EUR more ) .
POSITIVE	The experience was fantastic with a spectacular view of the old city .
NEGATIVE	The facilities are rubbish .
NEGATIVE	The first was in Berlin in 2017 and I withdrew my complaint and my complaint for the company 's apology and its offer to compensate for their incompetence .
POSITIVE	The fort is great to go to & the museum inside is was only 30 kuna for our family .
NEGATIVE	The GORAN I SPOKE WITH SAYS HES DOESNT HAVE A MANAGER HE ‰Ûª S JUST CUSTOMER SERVICE apparently he can ‰Ûª t answer questions because his dispatcher is waving at him .
POSITIVE	The gorgeous views made it all worth while .
NEGATIVE	The guide from the minibus picked up two other tourists then wanted to leave immediately , without even looking at us .
POSITIVE	The higher priced drinks might be worth it for more uninterrupted views .
POSITIVE	The homeland war museum is also an interesting visit .
NEGATIVE	The interior of the car was stinking after cold cigarette smoke and driver was chasing like there is no tomorrow .
NEGATIVE	The intial amount was refunded but the waiting charges weremt .
NEGATIVE	The issues were as follows : - Purchased tour clearly says ‰ÛÏ minibus ‰Û and ‰ÛÏ 18 persons is the maximum for this tour ‰Û  but everything was false.
POSITIVE	The journey up takes about 5 mins but the views going up and from the top are spectacular .
NEGATIVE	The lady at the ticket booth did not warn me that the route back would be so dangerous .
NEGATIVE	The line for the tram to get up and again down we ‰Ûª re horrible the Sunday sunset we were there .
NEGATIVE	The male running the cable car said he had phoned to the restaurant and shop but nothing had been handed in which I thought unlikely as the waiter would have seen them as he was heading to clear the table when we were leaving .
NEGATIVE	The manager is very rude and has no customer service .
NEGATIVE	The money was taken in CASH upfront and little did we know what we were getting ourselves into .
NEGATIVE	The most annoying part is there is no contact from the company at all .
POSITIVE	The Museum at the top is worth a visit too .
NEGATIVE	The office were extremely unprofessional , refusing to talk to us on the phone , and would not come to any agreement on their mistake , leaving us backed into a corner with the driver , holding us in the car on the side of a motorway and having to pay double the initial cost only so we did not miss ...

NEGATIVE	Unfortunately he was fumbling around for about 5-10 minutes , asking 4 people trying to figure out where to go .

NEGATIVE	Waiting for 35 mins was not reasonable especially when we had a flight to catch .

NEGATIVE	We accepted that disasters can happen but this is unforgivable
POSITIVE	We all enjoyed it and it was definitely worth the wait .
POSITIVE	We also had a couple of drinks in the restaurant that sits on the mountainside overlooking the bay - a seat on the edge affords the best views .
POSITIVE	We also had a nice meal in the restaurant near the cross with Panoramic views over the city and bay .
POSITIVE	We also visited the war museum which is housed in a building behind the visitor centre and which gave great insight into the homelands war , we had not been aware it was there but well worth a visit .
NEGATIVE	We are still awaiting our deposit back and the suggestion of a 5 % discount on a future booking is not very appealing in terms of compensation .

NEGATIVE	We dont recomed it to nobody !

NEGATIVE	We ended up on a hazardous route as the driver simply did not understand what he was doing .
NEGATIVE	We ended up spending only about 20 minutes up there as there is nothing else to do and I would only recommend if you a ) have the Dubrovnik city card or b ) like throwing money away .
POSITIVE	We enjoyed the exercise and the village showed its interesting tale of the 1991 Serb / Croat war .

POSITIVE	We spent a good couple of hours up here and got some really great snaps .
POSITIVE	We spent about an hour at the summit to take in the gorgeous sunset .

NEGATIVE	We waited 25 mins and finally hailed a taxi off the street and left .
NEGATIVE	We waited a long while for the cable car to go , even though there were more than enough people and the cable car was sat there waiting .
NEGATIVE	We waited and were given maps in the wrong language , and when I asked for one in English she said ‰ÛÏ it doesn ‰Ûª t matter ‰Û .
NEGATIVE	We waited for 2 hours at the border and we were not allowed off the bus because the Bosnian officials ' would not like it ' .

POSITIVE	We watched the sunset and it was great !

NEGATIVE	We were not contacted to say this was going to be the case .
NEGATIVE	We were not informed in advance that this was to happen Jan Sweden
NEGATIVE	We were not prepared however to be dropped at the North City gate which meant we had 123 steps to carry our luggage down .
POSITIVE	We were not really sure whether this would be worth it but I am so glad we did it - there was an absolutely spectacular view and I would highly recommend it to anyone !
NEGATIVE	We were one of the 1st couples to be dropped off in Dubrovnik at 8.15pm making it a 12 hour day .
NEGATIVE	We were only four people in 8 seater car , we were forced to seat in last .
NEGATIVE	We were picked up in a small van with just a driver .
POSITIVE	We were planning on going up just to see the view , then coming back down , but we ended up eating at the restaurant and having drinks , a nd staying until sundown .
NEGATIVE	We were recommended this tour but it really was not worth doing .
NEGATIVE	We were rip-offed slightly as we chose to do the cable car when we first arrived in Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	We were shuffled to a large coach bus and when I inquired with the tour guide about the minibus I was brushed off and told ‰ÛÏ sometimes they overbook and use the coach bus instead ‰Û .
NEGATIVE	We were so disappointed with this attraction .
NEGATIVE	We were sold ticket in basis of 10min wait,  when reaching queue it reflected more than an hour so we asked for a refund and came away !

NEGATIVE	We were worried we would not make our ferry .
POSITIVE	Weather was nice and so surprisingly there was not alotof people .

NEGATIVE	Well , consider it a sign of high customer service the reply ....
NEGATIVE	Well I was not disappointed once we reached the summit the views and scenery were fantastic .
NEGATIVE	Well it started with the ginormous earthworks happening across the road from the cable car entry, not anyone ‰Ûª s fault , but gave me a terrible pounding headache .
POSITIVE	Well priced , only buy tickets from official stores .
POSITIVE	Well priced and good fun . 
POSITIVE	well worth a couple of hours out of your day or evening just for the views .....
POSITIVE	Well worth doing .
POSITIVE	Well worth going up the cable car for the fantastic views over the town of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Well worth it !
POSITIVE	Well worth it for the superb view of the harbour and old town of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Well worth it though as the views are stunning .
POSITIVE	Well worth queuing for , quick and easy to purchase tickets and board car .
POSITIVE	Well worth the climb to go on this cable car it was lovely to sit in cafe at the top nand badmire the view .
POSITIVE	Well worth the money .
POSITIVE	Well worth the price to soar above the city and the old town .

POSITIVE	Went up on a lovely sunny day and the views were fantastic .
POSITIVE	What a great call !
POSITIVE	What a great experience !
NEGATIVE	What a waste of time .
NEGATIVE	WHAT I EXPECTED ( AND PAYED FOR ) : A Mercedes , with AC , ready to pickup me and my girl at the SPU airport and drop off us door to door at Riva Hotel in Hvar   that 's what their FAQ website sais they do as following : " Will I be dropped off at my accomodation ?
NEGATIVE	What kind of business agrees to provide a service for a certain amount of money , then puts you in a position to be forced to pay 50 % surcharge for their mistake ?
NEGATIVE	What let this trip down was the cost , the 120kn return ticket does not even cover the cost of the entry into the museum , which is an additional 30kn .
POSITIVE	What we didn ‰Ûª t realise is that the path is very uneven , rough and not at all easy to walk on in flip flops and crocks due to stones of various sizes .
POSITIVE	Whatever you choose , it 's time and money well spent !
NEGATIVE	when driver arrived he refused to take us stating that he had order from connecto for 08 passengers and his vehicle has maximum capacity for 8 passengers .
NEGATIVE	When I arrived home and made a formal complaint , it was explained to me that in fact , this company hires other companies to do the work and it had failed to make the booking for us .
NEGATIVE	When I asked them about it they said the supposed cars have had accidents on the way to my pickup .
NEGATIVE	When I asked these people if this was true , they did not acknowledge that a note exists .
NEGATIVE	When I came back down I asked if I could get a refund and instead I was given a leaflet and told I could make a complaint if I liked .
NEGATIVE	When I complained they advised if passenger misses a connecting flight or any other form of transportation due to circumstances not directly under their control , they can not be held accountable , or expected to cover the resulting expenses .
NEGATIVE	When I contacted the company to cancel our return booking and complain about the drop off I was told that they determine were the drop off will be not the customer and we were dropped there because it was convenient for the driver because he was running late for his next pick up .
NEGATIVE	When I feared I was going to miss the flight , I rang the head office to beg them to tell the taxi driver to turn around and take the motorway .
NEGATIVE	When I tried to call them , there was no answer , there is no telephone support out of hours .
NEGATIVE	When I tried to complain about this I was told that a private transfer to the hotel would have been a lot more expensive .
NEGATIVE	When phoning the call Centre we were informed that our transfer was cancelled .
NEGATIVE	When reached the beginning of the old town , guess what all clobbed flooring , my mum was unable to walk on that .
NEGATIVE	When she was questioned on it she accused people of not listening to her carefully .
POSITIVE	When the car stops go up to the top of the building for an even better view .
NEGATIVE	When the company called to confirm our trip yesterday we were told we could get by on credit card and no need for Euros, in Perast there were fees that our driver covered and despite paying $80 a person for a not so guided tour he made sure we took out Euros to reimburse him .
NEGATIVE	When they came nobody was there we try to call the agency but no answer .
POSITIVE	When visiting such a lovely city why would not you want to see it all .
NEGATIVE	When we are picked up several minutes after the agreed upon time , only the seats at the back of the bus are available .
NEGATIVE	When we arrived a person was waiting for us who then introduced us to another person and between them they spoke croatian in a very secretive manner being very unpleasant .
NEGATIVE	When we arrived at the first snorkel spot the boat pilot showed us the box of poor quality masks .
NEGATIVE	When we arrived st Kotor we got off the bus and there was no clear direction on where to meet .
NEGATIVE	When we asked for a refund , the woman on the cash desk had not idea it was closing and looked irritated that we ‰Ûª d even asked .
NEGATIVE	When we called them at 7.45 ( They had not called me during this time even though they had my number ) they said the bus was at our hotel but my son 's bus had left without him .
POSITIVE	When we got to to top we had lunch over looking all those beautiful views in the open restaurant .
NEGATIVE	When we got up to the terrace , we found it even more disappointing , since the cables were seen on the photos and there is no way to take a photograph , without those black lines .
POSITIVE	When we got up we were pleasantly surprised .
NEGATIVE	When we showed up at the designated time , we kept being told to wait as people piled into minivans .
NEGATIVE	When we went to the Tickets Point we found out that the ticket was 120Kn which was a bit too much for the facility .
POSITIVE	When you arrive at the top there are several safe viewing areas to take photographs .
POSITIVE	When you get to the top the views are uninterrupted and spectacular .
POSITIVE	Which made the HomelandWar exhibit in the fort next door all the more powerful .
NEGATIVE	While that might be true in law I feel like it 's not unreasonable to expect a premium transfer service ( we had the premium merc van ) to arrive with the seat safely fitted and ready to go .
POSITIVE	While the views are the main reason for taking the trip , I 'd also advise a visit to the war museum in the old fort for the history of the 91/92 siege and the war of independence .
POSITIVE	While there take the opportunity to visit the HomelandWar exhibition at FortImperial .
POSITIVE	While this is quite a touristy sight , it is definitely a must see !
NEGATIVE	While we were OK with the larger group , we felt cheated by the company because we had NO guide .
NEGATIVE	Whilst the view is great unless you want to be had over on price for a drink or food there is nothing to do here .
NEGATIVE	Whilst the weather was good in the morning , the cable car was closed - with no notice or explanation .
NEGATIVE	Whilst there may or may not be some explanation behind the decisions , the communication was non existent .
POSITIVE	Whilst we only wanted a cooling drink we were welcomed in the retaurant where you can sit , relax and look down on the city .
NEGATIVE	Who would possibly want to waste 4 hours of their holiday waiting unnecessarily at a ferry terminal .
NEGATIVE	Will not be returning to Dubrovnik anytime soon .
NEGATIVE	Will the trip is worth the view of the city below ? it is not worth the cost they charge .
POSITIVE	Windows are not necessarily the best for taking photos through on the way up but plentyof good views at the top .
NEGATIVE	WINE IS NOT UNLIMITED AS STATED ON HERE AND SAID WHEN BEING SOLD THE PACKAGE ON SHORE . when I questioned this the barman was horrifically rude and ushered me into the captains room to ‰ÛÏ SPEAK TO HIM ABOUT THIS ‰Û .
NEGATIVE	Wish that we could have gone up , but wanted to live to talk about it .
POSITIVE	With a stunning view both up and down the mountain .
POSITIVE	With the setting sun and looking down on LokrumIsland it 's delightful .
POSITIVE	With toilets , a gift shop and a bar , I dont think you can ask for more really .

POSITIVE	Wonderful restaurant at top worth stopping at for lunch & taking in the spectacular views .

POSITIVE	Worth finding time for without a doubt .
POSITIVE	Worth going up there to see Dubrovnik from above , the perspective made me simply happy .

NEGATIVE	Would I do this again? No. Waste of time and could have been better off hiring a car and taking the drive yourself .
NEGATIVE	Would never use the company again after this experience .
NEGATIVE	Would never use them again .

NEGATIVE	Would not recommend .
NEGATIVE	Would not recommend and am extremely dissapointed considering all of the reviews on here .
NEGATIVE	Would NOT recommend this Company .
NEGATIVE	Would not recommend this company .
NEGATIVE	Would not use again .
NEGATIVE	Would not waste the money or the time .
NEGATIVE	Would rather join a ground tour where part of the tour drives you up to the same location as the top of the cable car plus you get to see other attractions with a cheaper price .
NEGATIVE	Would rather pay more than be held to ransom by this lot .
NEGATIVE	Yes , it ‰Ûª s peak season so of course it ‰Ûª s going to be busy but the lack of any effective queuing plan means that waits to get in are extended significantly as people are constantly pushing in - and in truth , not on purpose because there is no clear signposting .
NEGATIVE	Yes , you are above the city but there is nothing to do once you get up there .
POSITIVE	Yes it 's pricey , but the view of the old town is simply spectacular .
NEGATIVE	Yet the guide still did not make any attempt to look at my confirmation letter or help me clarify things .
POSITIVE	You also have the option of buying a one way ticket and walking one way , which I would do on a nice day if I had the time .
NEGATIVE	You also have to queue in the searing heat which we did and it wasn ‰Ûª t even peak season .
NEGATIVE	You are also very crammed in .
POSITIVE	You can also spend a lot of time at the top having drinks and a meal , off road karting and taking lots of photos .
POSITIVE	You can drink / dine at the top or simply go up , take pictures and travel down again - but it is one not to be missed .
POSITIVE	You can enjoy a drink with a view which we enjoyed on a beautiful day .
NEGATIVE	You can get a better view of sun set and the city by getting a taxi or uber to the view point next to the cable car stop .
