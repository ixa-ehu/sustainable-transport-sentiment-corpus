NEGATIVE	 Not before . 
POSITIVE	 the viewing points at the top were equally superb and you could spend as long as you wanted up there .
NEGATIVE	( we only needed 3 taxis for 9 of us ) They refused to accept that this was a fault with their booking system and simply blamed the fact.
NEGATIVE	10 mins later and still with the same customer we walked away !
NEGATIVE	120kn for a return is a waste of money .
NEGATIVE	150 kn for a fast ride and then a huge line to go back !
NEGATIVE	2 weeks later and I have heard nothing from them .
NEGATIVE	20 sweaty people in a 2 square meter cable car .
NEGATIVE	3 days later email came through saying it was not 92 EURO as quoted but 213 EURO and I would have to accept the new amount before they could proceed .
NEGATIVE	30 people herded in to a carriage that should really only have held half that amount .
NEGATIVE	40 ‰âÂ for 2 person to go up is basically too much !
NEGATIVE	40 minutes into our journey we pointed out we were definitely going the wrong way - he had NO idea how to get to the airport and then had no idea we had a flight to catch .
NEGATIVE	45 minutes at the falls and 3 hours in Mostar meaning that our travel time was in excess of 8 hours !
NEGATIVE	45 minutes is not enough time at the waterfall .
NEGATIVE	5 minutes after the agreed time , I had a phone call from Connecttotransfers.com advising me ‰ÛÏ to make alternative arrangements ‰Û as they did not have a car or driver available .

POSITIVE	A few too many stairs for the elderly but well worth it .
NEGATIVE	A fight broke out , young boys pushed elderly folks out of the way to get out first and we lost 80 minutes of our day in an un-air-conditioned glass hot box .
POSITIVE	A gift shop , toilets and the panoramic restaurant Waits you at the top - we stayed for a meal and drinks and took the cable car back down after dark - saw an amazing sunset and viewed the city in all it 's lit up glory at night - great way to spend a few hours !
POSITIVE	A good chance to oversee the old city .

POSITIVE	A spectacular view over the old city , and the coast .
NEGATIVE	a total of 35 mins late , but we had left to the airport .
NEGATIVE	A total waste , if I knew this was the service they offered I would have just rented a car and gone myself .
POSITIVE	A vantage point for some excellent photographs .
POSITIVE	A very pleasant trip up in the cable car in a couple of minutes with the view getting better the higher you go .
NEGATIVE	A very short and expensive trip .
NEGATIVE	A very short ride for an expensive price of a view that was all most the same as that from the approach of a service bus .
NEGATIVE	A week had gone by and I e mailed the company to be told that they were still looking for a driver to assign to the transfer , and hope to provide me with a definite confirmation soon .
POSITIVE	A wonderful panoramic view at the top and a great way to view the OldCity .
POSITIVE	A worthwhile trip .
NEGATIVE	å£12 ( approx 15 Euros ) per person is too expensive .
POSITIVE	Abit expensive but worth it !
NEGATIVE	About 24 26 ‰âÂ for two trips of 2 minutes each , the view was nice but absolutely not worth the price , one of the most ridiculously overpriced things I have ever seen .
NEGATIVE	Absolute goons blackmailing us .
NEGATIVE	Absolute joke of a company , worst customer service I have ever come across .
NEGATIVE	Absolute joke of customer service .
POSITIVE	Absolutely beautiful .
POSITIVE	Absolutely eat at the restaurant at the top and try to get a table right on the edge .
POSITIVE	Absolutely fantastic !
NEGATIVE	Absolutely poor customer service only giving robotic replies not willing to understand or address my genuine grievances - without a doubt go with Octopus Transfers !
NEGATIVE	Absolutely shocking service , we were not met at the airport as the driver had been delayed .
NEGATIVE	Absolutely unacceptable .
POSITIVE	Absolutely worth the visit .
NEGATIVE	After , they gave us the receipt that I have attached as a picture ( of course we payed cash because at this point the feeling was strange of secrets being said in their ears between managers so I would never give them my card .
NEGATIVE	After 20 minutes , I travelled into town to attempt to find the bus at another stop .
NEGATIVE	After 30 min of waiting under the sun we complained and said that in 2 minutes the promised " van " white mercedes would arrive .
NEGATIVE	After 30 minutes Anna did finally update us and said that the bus driver went to have ‰ÛÏ teeth surgery ‰Û after he dropped us off earlier , and that is why he was late .
NEGATIVE	After 30 minutes they rang to cancel the booking .
POSITIVE	After enjoying walking around the top area and checking out the sights , we found a weary looking couple who had walked up , gave them our unwanted tickets then found the path and descended on foot .
NEGATIVE	After I accepted another email came through saying they made a mistake and it would be 213 EURO after all .
NEGATIVE	After leaving my wife with the cases i had to walk to find the accommodation , which was across the very busy main road into Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	After much discussion they offered the number for a taxi company , but that company failed to pick up others so we waited out the storm and walked down in the dark , very late at night .
NEGATIVE	After not finding the bus , i called the tour operator who off the bat yelled at me on the phone claiming the bus had waited and was already on its way to Montenegro .
NEGATIVE	After one hour of looking and a call to the office ( message left , no one answered ) , we had to make other arrangements or waste the day .
NEGATIVE	After our first stop , we attempted to change seats as she had not announced any seating policy .
NEGATIVE	After requesting cancellation of transfers within minutes of making them and specifically requesting cancellation without charges - they did not specify they would deduct money and instead replied we have cancelled your transfers as requested .
NEGATIVE	After seeing the length and height of the cable car , we are happy to say that it would not be worth the money .
NEGATIVE	After spending 15 minutes at the top , we decided to get the cable car down again .
NEGATIVE	After that , I received a very rude , vindictive response from the owner .
POSITIVE	After that tAke a deep breath and enjoy the ride both ways .
NEGATIVE	After the company made a mistake in misquoting our fare , they were then unwilling to compromise on a price and charged us double the original price given , even after admitting it was their own mistake .
NEGATIVE	After the first stop , we tell the tour guide , Nicholina , that we are unhappy at the back of the van and inform her that we would like to change seats .
NEGATIVE	After waiting on hold for another 10 minutes I hung up and called back .
POSITIVE	Afterwards we walked to local village Bosanka ( about a mile ) and had a terrific lunch at KonobaDubrava - well worth the walk !
POSITIVE	Again , another spectacular view of the walled city , just a different perspective .
NEGATIVE	Again , frustratingly , the cruise groups were given a priority and we had to wait .
NEGATIVE	Again no further contact was received .
NEGATIVE	Again this was not the case and we only ended up finding the place when my wife rang and forced the issue .
POSITIVE	All in all , not to be missed !
NEGATIVE	All in all this is a tourist trap .
POSITIVE	Allow time to take in the view from the cafŽ at the top .
POSITIVE	Alongwith that , there is a restaurant up here where you can enjoy your meal with this view .
NEGATIVE	Also , the stops in each city were not adequate .
POSITIVE	also a great museum worth visiting which shows the story of the recent war with actual footage from the time .
POSITIVE	Also do not miss the Museum about the Croatian War of Independence in the fort at the top .
POSITIVE	Also do stop in the restaurant at the top , even if it 's just a drink ! 
POSITIVE	Also the buggies can be found at the top of the hill , these were also good fun !
POSITIVE	Also the museum is worth a visit .
POSITIVE	Also the walk through the old town was fascinating .
POSITIVE	Also there is a museum p there about the war in the 90 's which is fascinating .
POSITIVE	Also try the panorama bar restaurant at the top , it 's great to have a drink with this view .
POSITIVE	Although always busy the queue shortens quickly .
POSITIVE	Although I do not have a head for heights , I really enjoyed the cable car !
POSITIVE	Although it is expensive it is a great joy to ride it .
NEGATIVE	Although they have an elevator , it does not go to the upper observation level .
POSITIVE	Although very crowded with bus loads of tourists , the view from the top of the old town and panoramic views of the Adriatic sea and coastline are just simply fabulous .
POSITIVE	Amazing views and worth every penny .
POSITIVE	Amazing views from the top , and a restaurant , and shop ( we did not buy anything ).
POSITIVE	An excellent way to view the old city without climbing all the steps .
POSITIVE	An exceptional and must-see view of Dubrovnik's Old Town and coastline, as well as of Montenegro 's mountain , both from the cable car and the multilevelled platform at the top of Mount Srd ! 
NEGATIVE	And a Korean tourist group formed a human wall to block off the best photo location until they can take pictures one by one .
POSITIVE	And do not stop there ; climb the steep stairs to the top of the fort and the views are even better , not least because the cables of the cable car are not in the way .
NEGATIVE	And if you ask questions and react to the fact that you paid a return ticket for going down as well you are being told you are ridiculous and if you want to o back to the city you need to walk .
POSITIVE	And it is not expensive !
NEGATIVE	And she has still not established a fair and flexible seating policy that does not unfairly penalize people for the minivan pickup order that they have no control over .
POSITIVE	And we lucked out as it was right before sunset began .
NEGATIVE	And you need to pay extra money for the waterfall so I won ‰Ûª t give a higher rate of the tour because of the it .
POSITIVE	Another tick off the list , Stunning views beautiful restaurant at the top off the mountain if you do not do anything else DO this  .
NEGATIVE	Anyway 45 mins later with an extremely anxious wife the taxi turned up .
NEGATIVE	Apart from the schedule , the guide of the whole trip is really bad .
NEGATIVE	Apparently they ‰Ûª ve been jacking up the prices every year .
NEGATIVE	As a result of the no show , we missed our flight from Geneva and had to buy seats on a later flight .
NEGATIVE	As a result of using this service , I almost missed my flight .
NEGATIVE	As a side note , there was an issue with the seatbelts on the mini bus .
POSITIVE	As another reviewer advised , try to go to the ' rear ' of the car for the best view out at the city as you ascend or descend .
POSITIVE	As another Tripadvisor reviewer commented , the view is best from the top floor of the War Museum housed in the old fort originally built by Napoleon that was the protector of Dubrovnik during the 1990s siege .
NEGATIVE	As everything else in Dubrovnik the cable car is crazy expensive ( and I live in Paris ‰ÛÓ used to very high prices ) .
NEGATIVE	As of this writing , Nicholina has not made amends .
NEGATIVE	As soon as the call ended , I immediately received an e mail to say that my transfers had been cancelled .
POSITIVE	As you get into the cable car head to the front for an incredible view as you descend .
POSITIVE	As you rise , fantastic view of the old city builds up .
POSITIVE	Aswell as the spectacular views there is also a restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	At about £15 each it is much better than walking up and there are lovely views on the way !
NEGATIVE	At least it is very short which in this case was a blessing .
NEGATIVE	At one point we were told to follow her and she literally walked around in a circle .
NEGATIVE	At over å£20 per person ,  the cable ride is far too quick and does not give enough time to appreciate the views.
NEGATIVE	At the border there was a hassle with the drivers documents we think as he was taken away for around 20 minutes with no explanation even when he got back .
NEGATIVE	At the end of the trip , we were abruptly told we would not be dropped off at our original pickup location and were left in the middle of the road about a half mile from our pickup location ( the local bus stop ) .
POSITIVE	At the top , relax and have a bite to eat at the restaurant , or walk through the war museum , or just marvel at the gorgeous sights .
POSITIVE	At the top is a fort to view and a great place to eat and drink which we did .
POSITIVE	At the top is a restaurant & more superb views of the city .
POSITIVE	at the top of MtStd will see the best view of old town wall and surrounding are and island , never to miss if if visiting dubrobnik ....
POSITIVE	At the top of the cable car , you are able to see Old Dubrovnik in all of its entirety with the encapsulating city walls .
POSITIVE	At the top of the cable car is the fort which is currently hosting a fantastic exhibition of the war in 1990/1991 .
POSITIVE	At the top the panoramic views of this beautiful city are breathtaking .
POSITIVE	At the top there is a souvenir shop , a restaurant and a museum aswell as several free viewing decks .
NEGATIVE	At this point , she asked us to move as two people who sat there ‰ÛÏ had written a note ‰Û requesting for the seat .
NEGATIVE	AVOID .
NEGATIVE	Avoid at all costs .
NEGATIVE	Avoid this company .
NEGATIVE	AVOID THIS COMPANY This company failed to turn up for a transfer to the airport from the hotel which meant we almost missed our flight .
POSITIVE	Awesome way to spend an evening in Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	BE ALERT   This company are not reliable , and they don ` t let the things CLEARLY .
POSITIVE	Be sure to climb to the top of the fortress , where you will get a 360 degree view of the area ; the interior stairs look questionable , but they are fine .
POSITIVE	Be sure to go to the Museum of Croatian War of Independence in the fort too , where you can also climb onto the roof and see even better views !
NEGATIVE	Be very careful and check with the taxi driver what the cost is likely to be before you start the journey .
NEGATIVE	Bearing it mind it was change over day so every other transfer company was already fully booked we eventually found a taxi which cost an arm and a leg .
POSITIVE	Beautiful view from the top !
POSITIVE	Beautiful view of the city from the top !
POSITIVE	Beautiful view really worth going up to see it has a lovely restaurant and bar looking over Debrocnick also it 's a romantic place for couples . 
POSITIVE	Beautiful views .
POSITIVE	Beautiful views for miles along the coast and the mountains - lovely restaurant views also .
POSITIVE	Beautiful views from the top and a cool restaurants which i recommend having a drink at !
POSITIVE	Beautiful views on the way and at the top .
POSITIVE	Beautiful vistas .
NEGATIVE	Because of our constant complaining pne of them left until the end of the taxi line to bring one .
NEGATIVE	Because of the huge contrast , I can said that the tour guide of this trip is really bad !
NEGATIVE	Because of the noshow I requested a refund from Connecto .
NEGATIVE	Being still on the cruise at 30 min of arriving to the port , we decided to contact VIDOKRUG ( tel +385 98 9363 767 ) because apparently it had " good " reviews .
NEGATIVE	Besides , he was cursing and commenting everything on the way of 20km .
NEGATIVE	Best avoided .
POSITIVE	Best drinks at restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	Best photo ops of OldTown from above .
POSITIVE	Best view of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Bizarre and greedy , better get a taxi up there for your money .
POSITIVE	Bliss .
NEGATIVE	Blocked the whole panorama desk for at least half an hour to take individual / group photos .
NEGATIVE	Booked 7 weeks ago and now told whilst in transit via email that they have got the fee wrong need to pay 80 euro more if you want the transfer .
NEGATIVE	Booked last year car was late .
NEGATIVE	Booking a taxi with this company is complicated and unprofessional .
NEGATIVE	Border security wait was about an hour and we  don't expected that .
NEGATIVE	Both times the drivers messed up .
NEGATIVE	Both times they have send a standard car without notice me or changed the price .
POSITIVE	Both views were excellent .
POSITIVE	Breathtaking, good views from the car .
NEGATIVE	Bus took us to Old Town after 25 min wait where we were supposed to have 1.5hrs .
NEGATIVE	But 140 kuna is robbery .
NEGATIVE	But at the ' end of the day ' it all depends on how wealthy or daft you are to spend money like that I suppose .
NEGATIVE	But he just did it this morning in Lyon when he warned me one hour in advance to look for a taxi because they can not do the service to the airport .
NEGATIVE	But i can not get past this child seat and late arrival issue - it 's fundamental for an airport transfer , and the company just fell seriously short .
POSITIVE	But I did get to have a delicious ice cream !
NEGATIVE	But I do not find the top of the hill anything special .
NEGATIVE	But I do not know what services are worth paying for on this trip .
NEGATIVE	But in this case Connecto is not interested in this - for us serious incident .
NEGATIVE	But it ‰Ûª s not true , they might pay me back I don ‰Ûª t know .
NEGATIVE	But sadly the only option i see to get up there is with Uber and we payed 55kuna at 22 in the evening to drive us down back to Pile gate .
NEGATIVE	But skip the cable car if you can .
POSITIVE	But the best part is just next to it .
NEGATIVE	BUT the planning of the tour is not that good , We met at 7am , but we have no place to have a breakfast , only a place selling coffee ( quite good and really cheap ) .
NEGATIVE	But there was no driver to pick us up .
POSITIVE	But to fully appreciate the beauty of Dubrovnik , ride the cable car ride to one of the most scenic overviews you will see in Croatia .
POSITIVE	But we beat them on and took the prime viewing spot , so yay !
POSITIVE	But we do not subscribe to PC and this was great fun .
POSITIVE	But we went by coach tour and had an interesting view of single lane roads around hill tops .
NEGATIVE	But we wiched we stayed in old town .
NEGATIVE	But what was disastrous was that the cable car was said to have " broken down " when we tried to take it down hill after looking at the sunset .
NEGATIVE	But when we arrived at the airport of Split on our way back the driver opened the boot lid and our baby buggy dropped down and the foot part crushed .
NEGATIVE	By far the most expensive couple of minutes cable car ride I have ever taken .
POSITIVE	By getting to the top of the cable car you will not be disappointed with the photo opportunity of getting the whole of the walled city in one shot .
NEGATIVE	By then there was total confusion and people were getting into taxis that others had called for in desperation .
NEGATIVE	By this point I am losing my rag and I am getting nowhere with customer services who just said that the person was NEW and made a mistake .
NEGATIVE	By this time the second car had descended , however , another 10 minutes passed before the ticket office opened .
POSITIVE	By waiting until the rush had gone , we got a great view and no hassle .
POSITIVE	Cable car gives quick access to spectacular views over Dubrovnik and out to the islands .
POSITIVE	Cable car is the way to go to see the best scenic views of Old Town and coastline all along Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Cable car operators should take extreme interest in who they have selling their attraction .
POSITIVE	Cafe up there is good as well .
NEGATIVE	Called med one day before departure to tell me that it costed 26 euros more .
NEGATIVE	Called the helpline to CONFIRM the price which was approved by customer services .
NEGATIVE	Called their office 3 times and they kept saying driver was on the way in 3 mins .
NEGATIVE	Can get as good a view from the highway .
POSITIVE	Can not really describe it in words so I added a view photos ... I think it is worth the cost of admission .
POSITIVE	Can not think of a better way to spend an evening or a location for al fresco dining !
POSITIVE	Cant mind price , maybe 10euro or so , worth every penny .
NEGATIVE	Carried on with my sister , then when reaching the bottom noticed that a transport train made it down to the waterfall was really annoyed that we was not informed that is was a possible .
NEGATIVE	Changed dates for a return trip , they confirmed it and no driver showed up !
POSITIVE	Check out the cafe / restaurant and enjoy a drink whilst taking in the view !
NEGATIVE	Come on , something must be done about this but I am sure as long as people are willing to pay then why not ?
NEGATIVE	Communicated by text message the evening before the pick up and confirmed that ride would be at our hotel at 8am .
NEGATIVE	Complete waste of 100kn .
NEGATIVE	Completely disgusted by this service and poor communication from this company .
NEGATIVE	Completely unreliable .
NEGATIVE	Connecto now offers us a 10 % voucher for the next transfer as a compensation and told us ( after more than one email ) , that this is everything they can do for us !
NEGATIVE	Consider booking a return trip in a taxi it would be a lot cheaper !
NEGATIVE	cost 85 kuna per pax , not worth the journey up as it is expensive .
POSITIVE	Could have spent hours just looking down .
POSITIVE	Definitely bring your camera and do not miss taking the cable car , which I believe goes up and down every 10 minutes .
POSITIVE	Definitely not to be missed  .
POSITIVE	Definitely the best views along the Adriatic coast and probably the best steak !
POSITIVE	Definitely worth doing , great cafe at the top too , with spectacular views .
POSITIVE	Definitely worth the walk as the views of the old town and outlying islands are amazing but wear sensible shoes !
NEGATIVE	Did I mention that the lightening was robust and close ?
NEGATIVE	Did not even explain that there are dangerous steps .
NEGATIVE	Do not board a larger minubus .
NEGATIVE	Do not book this Company .

NEGATIVE	Don ‰Ûª t waste your money and time !
POSITIVE	Don Õ t worry if you Õ re not a fan of heights ... the ride is quite quick and the scenery is so spectacular you Õ ll be too amazed to be scared .
NEGATIVE	Driver did not show up and help line did not answer calls .
NEGATIVE	Driver offered alternate vehicle through his friend / colleague and took us to milan but on arriving he asked us to pay fresh amount ( twice of what we had already paid in advance ) , when we defended he locked the vehicle and asked us to pay and than only he will release our baggage .
NEGATIVE	Driver spoke reasonable good English but gave us no commentary on Dubrovnik whatsoever .
NEGATIVE	Drivers are very rude to talk .
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik historical city is absolutely fantastic .
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik is a beautiful city to walk and explore .
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik is such a beautiful place and one way to see this is by doing this and going up the cable car .
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik Old Town is magical and nowhere more so than at the top of the mountain , accessed by the cable car !
POSITIVE	Dune buggies were available for driving !
POSITIVE	Each car hold 30 passengers so queueing time is not too long .
NEGATIVE	Early pick up also went wrong as the company insisted we had to leave earlier due to expected weather conditions , only to show up at the previously set time, leaving us waiting for almost an hour w / o any possibility to contact them as they do not pick up the phone before 8.00am .
POSITIVE	Easily accessible from the city walls , a short walk which is clearly marked .
NEGATIVE	Emailed requesting a refund and I have been ignored .

POSITIVE	Enjoyed a cappuccino at a quaint cafe once I arrived at the top and explored the ImperialFortress .
POSITIVE	Enjoyed a good beer on top of the city .
NEGATIVE	Enjoyed time at top got slightly muddy shoes and was refused entry for return by young overzealous jobsworth , this spoiled our impression of Dubrovnik
POSITIVE	Enjoying the view over Dubrovnik and its surrounding landscape for 108 kuna .
NEGATIVE	Especially because no one says it really but you can either walk up there either go by car ( 10/15 min from Dubrovnik ) .
NEGATIVE	Especially if you are in a group , even a Taxi would be much cheaper per person .
NEGATIVE	Even more disgruntled that we did not even get an apology from the company !
NEGATIVE	Even the other people in the same tour show more care than the guide , asking me do I need some cash to take the bus .
NEGATIVE	Everything is three times the price as in the town as your a captive audience .
NEGATIVE	Everything they confirmed in their emails were lies .

POSITIVE	Excellent views of the bays , including LapadBay where the Kompas hotel is , and the mountains .
POSITIVE	Excellent views of the city and surrounding islands .
POSITIVE	Excellent views of the old town and surrounding countryside .
POSITIVE	Exciting ascent , realisation of the sacrifice made by the Croation people during the Balkan war ( 1991 - 1995 ) , again a restaurant selling food and drink at the same cost as the Old Town .
POSITIVE	Exciting ride up , a few bumps that caused gasps onboard .
NEGATIVE	Executives at Connecto suddenly became helpless and did not offer any solution and we were left stranded at foreign land on our vacation on road .
NEGATIVE	Expensive , and crammed in so that even standing is difficult and unless you are very lucky and the first one in the cab no chance of seeing much or taking a photo .
POSITIVE	Expensive , but worth it for the views ( especially the sunset if you time your trip correctly ) .
NEGATIVE	Expensive and disappointing give it a miss.
NEGATIVE	Expensive and slow because of queues .
NEGATIVE	Expensive restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	Extremely disappointed at the way we were treated today .
NEGATIVE	Extremely disappointed with the service .

POSITIVE	Fab views of old city from top & has an interesting museum within the fort on the war .
NEGATIVE	False information !
POSITIVE	Fantasic Views and a good restaurant at the top , we went to the war museum and it was first class , a bit pricey for the cable car but it is what it is .
POSITIVE	Fantastic !
POSITIVE	Fantastic 360 views and there is a restaurant / cafe at the top for refreshments .
POSITIVE	Fantastic panoramic views of the area and we even had local cattle join us at the top.
POSITIVE	Fantastic photo ops .
NEGATIVE	First three telephone calls failed .
NEGATIVE	Firstly it was outrageous that a mature couple would be dropped at North City gate when the driver new that we would have to carry two large suitcases and two cabin bags down the 123 steps and then that the company justified this by saying it was their choice not ours .
NEGATIVE	Firstly they are more expensive .
NEGATIVE	Firstly told by Dino it would cost approx 200-250 Kuna ‰Ûª s although we thought this was a bit pricey he advised us that the meter would be on .
NEGATIVE	For a 5 min trip after standing in seeming endless queue it was really not worth the money .
NEGATIVE	For a reason my booking was cancelled and the website clearly states no charge for 5 days notice for standard taxi and 24 hours notice for luxury .
NEGATIVE	For that you get a 3 minute ride to the viewing platform then queue for 30 minutes to come back down .
NEGATIVE	For your own sake book a regular bus or atleast another company , you are honestly being robbed .
NEGATIVE	Forget seeing anything out of the cable car as they are too packed .
NEGATIVE	Found car to be very crouded and claustrophobic so not much of view unless you were next to window .
NEGATIVE	Our tour guide - Anna - was very hurried and disorganized .
NEGATIVE	The information she gave was sterile and impersonal - we could have gotten the same info by doing a google search .
NEGATIVE	They confirmed my booking emailing my with a wrong driver ` s phone number ; - They driver did not speak any word in English , they did not have change to my payment .
NEGATIVE	When we arrived at the small island , Anna told us all the wrong time ( in English and Spanish ) to be back at the boat .
