NEGATIVE	We suggest to go by car on the hill as there is a road that goes up and you will get many beautiful photos as well as you will have your own time and then you can spend the 15 € for a nice coffe in the cafe-restaurant on the hill with the most amazing view of old town and rest of Dubrovnik ! ! !
NEGATIVE	2 cars on the line means that long waits ( over an hour ) are possible and there is absolutely no shelter from that merciless sun whilst queuing .
NEGATIVE	5 out of 5 for the spectacular view of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic . 2 out of 5 for the actual cable car .
POSITIVE	A bit expensive but driving by car is much dangerous .
POSITIVE	A can not miss for the best view of the city .
POSITIVE	A great restaurant at the top - " Panorama " .
POSITIVE	A great way to get a different view of the city .
POSITIVE	A great way to see the surrounding countryside and spectacular views of the Old Town .
POSITIVE	A museum at the top in an old fort and also good restaurant .
POSITIVE	A must do , you can see the entire Adriatic coast from here , take about 10 minutes to go up , you might need a head for heights though .
POSITIVE	A must thing to see !
POSITIVE	A must visit when staying in Dubrovnik , a short walk from the old town and you get the most incredible views .
POSITIVE	A perfect place to view the beauty of old town wall city DUBROVNIK ( UNESCO world heritage site ) .
POSITIVE	A quick journey up in the cable car and you are at the top looking at fantastic views across the old city and Islands beyond .
POSITIVE	A short trip to reach amazing views .
POSITIVE	A short walk from Ploce gate .
POSITIVE	A splendidly modern cable car , with big windows for lots of photographs , whisks you smoothly from the city walls to the top of the hil .
POSITIVE	A very steep climb up numerous steps from the old town centre ; however the Cable Car Entrance can be accessed from a street running behind the old city ( on foot or by taxi ) .
NEGATIVE	Add that the trip is not 2h45min as they claim , but 3h30min - each way !
NEGATIVE	Advice - if you have an grumpy unfriendly tour guide , block their behaviour out as best as you can and enjoy the sights for what it is !
NEGATIVE	After 30 minutes found ourself coming in to another port ( was not informed that we will be picking up other passengers beforehand ) we had a long wait for passport control to come round even though we were still in the same country , and astonishing amount of passengers to board , some with luggage...
NEGATIVE	After a 4 hour trip home on choppy seas we then had to wait 30mins to get off after the Catamaran had docked as yet the staff felt it best to unload the baggage first , not very customer friendly after the journey , in the heat and with many passengers in a rust to get back for dinner .
NEGATIVE	After a while we noticed that there were problems with the ship  boat engine .
NEGATIVE	After being picked up , our skipper told us that there was a miss understanding even though we called a day before to check the meeting point .
POSITIVE	After that tAke a deep breath and enjoy the ride both ways .
NEGATIVE	After that the guiding stops .
NEGATIVE	Again no mention of sea conditions to forewarn everyone to expect a bumpy ride .
NEGATIVE	Again we fortunately had assistance from the apartment owner who sorted this out for us pick up back to airport was late due to " stuck in traffic " however this seems bad planning as Split seems to consistently have a lot of traffic Finally neither vehicles we used had any taxi markings which was a...
NEGATIVE	All and all the Venezia Lines Ferry is just a ferry to Venice .
POSITIVE	All in , my pictures from the too are well worth the fee to ride the cable car
POSITIVE	All in all , not to be missed ! !
POSITIVE	Along with the City Walls , this is an absolute must do in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Also , I has out of this world panoramic views of the City Walls , port and Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Also , strangely , the path ends at the bottom on a main road , which meant we needed to walk through back alleys to get home , so might get a return ticket next time
NEGATIVE	Also if you are late by 2mins , your tour guide may scold you for lateness as ours did !
NEGATIVE	Also it takes 10mins to walk from the waterfalls to the bus at the top of the hill once you factor other tour groups and people at the site .
POSITIVE	Also there is a museum p there about the war in the 90 's which is fascinating .
POSITIVE	Although it only takes a couple of minutes both to ascend and decend , at HRK120 ( about €17 ) it may seem a bit expensive but it 's well worth it , and there is the option of a one-way trip for HRK70 if you are feeling up to walking back down .
NEGATIVE	Although not pressured into buying the extras the reality of prices in Venice ( not provided by the company ) were over exaggerated .
POSITIVE	Amazing history of 1991 so glad to have done this .
POSITIVE	Amazing scenery and a nice breeze to cool down after a hot stroll in old town .
POSITIVE	amazing view over Dubrovnik , once you have seen enough pop into the café , have an absinthe and stay until the second gondola is heading back down
POSITIVE	Amazing views a must do if in dubrovnik , entire city scope from above , reasonable price , i highly recommend .
POSITIVE	An absolute MUST - though it does get busy , we were very lucky and timed it just right .
POSITIVE	An easy walk from the old city of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	And it is actually according to the wikipedia ( it is the shortes in the WORLD ) .
NEGATIVE	And it was for a distace of 30km - they did not have to take that ride and back !
POSITIVE	Another vital tourist must do .
POSITIVE	Approximately 30 guests inside each car .
NEGATIVE	Arrived early in the morning to take the cable car to the war museum , must say I was quite excited and a little anxious about the ride !
NEGATIVE	As an example when it came to transport around the city they did not even mention the vaporettos or the 24 hour tickets you can get for 20Euros ( there is a stop right next to the ferry port ) .
NEGATIVE	As the trip started , he was using his phone about 90 % of the time which left us feeling a bit unappreciated .
POSITIVE	As we went to Dubrovnik beginning of November to mid November , the town was quiet , very quiet , which meant there was zero queue for the cable car and almost nobody at the top !
NEGATIVE	As we were the second couple in the queue managed to get a place at the front of the car on the ascent and must say the view and ride are spectacular , however the car was absolutely packed , we were like sardines and as I found on the descent it was impossible to see anything apart from the body ne...
NEGATIVE	As you can imagine .
NEGATIVE	At around 18 quid this is just too much to ask .
NEGATIVE	At first , we have been left at the meeting point to wait for about 20 minutes which was quite unpleasant as the outside temperature was high .
POSITIVE	At first glance the cost of the cable car seems a lot ( 150 Kuna per person return or about £17 ) as the journey takes but a few minutes .
POSITIVE	At lease stay for a drink or two and watch the sun go down .
NEGATIVE	At least 3 couples were having their shots taken there .
NEGATIVE	At the top is is a restaurant and souvenir shop .
POSITIVE	At the top of the cable car they have a resturant , a viewing terrace and thats about it , but its worth the trip for the views ! !
POSITIVE	At this time you get to see the sun setting over the old town .
NEGATIVE	Avoid it unless you are desperate for photos .
POSITIVE	Be sure to climb to the top of the fortress , where you will get a 360 degree view of the area ; the interior stairs look questionable , but they are fine .
POSITIVE	Beautiful view , well maintained and no que even in the high season for unplanned trip , we stopped for coffee and ice cream at the top to let the view sink in .
POSITIVE	Beautiful view of the whole city from the cable car and surprising that it did not wobble even on a very windy day !
POSITIVE	Beautiful vistas .
POSITIVE	Before I went I checked other reviews and read about people complaining that it was expansive and that the cables were obstructing the View .... Well it Is well Worth the ride and as for taking pictures without cables it Is possible you just have to leave the tower there Is another plat form on the ...
POSITIVE	Brilliant views of course .
POSITIVE	But make some time to walk around at the top and you can get some equally stunning views of other parts of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	But make sure to go by car  bus to the Italian coast .
NEGATIVE	But that was not really the cable car peoples fault .
NEGATIVE	But there is no chance of that .
NEGATIVE	But we were wrong .
NEGATIVE	But you can just walk around and visit all the usual places .
POSITIVE	Buy the ticket online or at the actual cable car hub as it is cheaper than the “ non-commission ” vendors .
POSITIVE	Buy your tickets in the old town or any agency , i do not know if they cost any more but it 's well worth avoiding the 45 minute wait in the sweltering heat .
NEGATIVE	By the way , there is a staircase nearby , so you get on top faster than the funicular .
POSITIVE	Cable car can be good value depending on the size of your group and number of adults - 80 kuna ( one way ) and 130 kuna ( round trip ) per ticket gets pricey with a large group .
POSITIVE	Cafe at the top and option for jeep safari .
POSITIVE	Cafe at top is okay - setting is nicer than the food , but good place to stop for a drink .
POSITIVE	Can be crowded if you arrive close to sunsets .
POSITIVE	Can get quite busy but well worth the trip .
NEGATIVE	Certainly , weather did not seem to be the issue .
POSITIVE	Children friendly and a very nice restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	Coach and tour parties are frequent visitors and can swell the queue markedly .
NEGATIVE	Compared to other funiculars I have been on , it looked liked this would only take 3 minutes to go up and down .
NEGATIVE	Conclusion : Do not take this ferry trip .
NEGATIVE	Cost 100 kunar , approx £10.00 return
POSITIVE	Cost is 100 kuna ( they will not accept euros ) tickets can be bought at the souvenir shop just a short walk away , or they can be bought at the cable car entrance .
POSITIVE	Cost per an adult round-trip ticket is 140 kn .
POSITIVE	Could be very warm inside in July .

NEGATIVE	Definitely one to avoid during the heat of the day .
NEGATIVE	Despite the very rough weather , many green faces and a lot of confusion we were not given any reassurance by the staff until 2 hours into the trip .
NEGATIVE	Disappointed .
NEGATIVE	Disappointing .
POSITIVE	Do it early before the long lines form once the cruise ships hit town
POSITIVE	Do not leave dubrovnik and its beautiful people and culture with out taking this trip . , christine & tony .
POSITIVE	Do not miss this !
POSITIVE	Do not miss this attraction .
NEGATIVE	Do some research beforehand , go on a private gondola and expect to have a choppy journey so take some sea sickness tablets if you are affected !
POSITIVE	Do visit the museum of the war , housed in the ruins of the fortress .
NEGATIVE	During this hour of waiting without any shade , two women fainted , this did not prompt the staff to start the boarding process as they loaded bags first .
POSITIVE	Easy to find from the Old Town and luckily no crowds . 94 Euros for a return ticket and then you had to pay extra if you wanted to visit the War museum .
POSITIVE	Efficient means of transport up the mountain - faster than a car .
POSITIVE	Either walk or take Dubrovnik Cable Car to appreciate aesthetic Dubrovnik Old Town in a panoramic fashion .
POSITIVE	Enjoyed a cappuccino at a quaint cafe once I arrived at the top and explored the Imperial Fortress .
POSITIVE	Entrance cost 30 kn and I purchased my tickets with my cable car ticket 100kn .
NEGATIVE	Entrance to Italy was more efficient than the warnings given by guide . we booked gondolas as reccommended by the guide and venezian line , would not have done this if we knew that gondolas were easy to get and that gondola prices were fixed eur 80 , - basicly at a lower cost than offered by venezia...
NEGATIVE	Even though they new nothing about what was going on .
NEGATIVE	Eventually did ring owner who fortunately found us .
NEGATIVE	Everybody on board got up very early and could really use a nice nap on the way - but was forced to hear this pitches in three languages .
NEGATIVE	Everything was clean and well organized .
POSITIVE	Ew understanding .

POSITIVE	Famous view on city city from top , well organized , clean , perfect experience .
POSITIVE	Fantastic views on the ride up with plenty to do at the top .
POSITIVE	Fast an efficient and without doubt go into the war museum !
NEGATIVE	Few days later they charged me the whole amount .
POSITIVE	Find the museum over to the left of the car entrance and watch the newsreel , it is worth it .
NEGATIVE	First transfer was successful , second one driver was not to be found .
NEGATIVE	For example we were informed the walk from the port to the city centre would take an hour minimum and therefore strongly advised to pay extra for a taxi with the company , the walk in actual fact took no longer that 30mins .
POSITIVE	For those traveling in the summer , please note the car is not air conditioned so when it gets crowded the ride can be a bit hot and stuffy , but the ride is short and views from the top are worth it .
NEGATIVE	From Porec there was around a 2 and a half hour journey in to Venice .
NEGATIVE	From the moment we are on route the company start ' selling ' a map and a pen with a contact number in case of an emergency - €5 .
POSITIVE	Get different views of the stratun and the old city walls .
POSITIVE	Get there early if you can , avoid the rush once at the top you can get amazing views of the old city and beyond , the tours tend to stay for a short while and then its not too busy , we where there at the end of June
POSITIVE	Gift shop , toilets and restaurant are all available at the top .
POSITIVE	Gives the best view of Dubrovnik and the sea .
POSITIVE	Go at 9:00 to avoid the crowds .
POSITIVE	Go early or late , as the lines will be long , especially if there are many large ships in the harbor .
POSITIVE	Go see it .
NEGATIVE	Going up a little more challenging that of course going down .

POSITIVE	Great views .
POSITIVE	Great views of Dubrovnik and the islands .
POSITIVE	Great views of the city  and countryside Restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	Great way to see the old town , the Adriatic Sea and islands .
NEGATIVE	Had to wait for the next car as first one was full but wait was not long ( May so pre-season )
NEGATIVE	Having visited Dubrovnik a few times , the cable car was still on our to do list , however this visit we had time , what a disappointment , although we were lucky enough to not have to queue , there were a lot of people on the viewing platform which greatly restricted the photo opportunities .
NEGATIVE	He texted me back that he would be at least 30 more minutes before he could get there .
NEGATIVE	He was rude , threatening , and gave them a real fright .
NEGATIVE	hello my name is joao , i came with a group of 50 persona and in the first day dindt work , we were all inside and just stop working , 2 day after we come back and we could go , unfortunately the service is not the best but ia a good view .
POSITIVE	Highly recommend going up the cable car when you visit Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Highly recommend to any Dubrovnik visitor !
POSITIVE	Highly recommended
POSITIVE	Highly recommended .
POSITIVE	Homelands War exhibition just behind the top station was interesting and moving .
NEGATIVE	However , for approximately 90 minutes on the way to Venice and 30 minutes on the way back , the crew kidnapped us and forced us to hear lengthy sales pitches , intended to sell the Venezia Lines tours , Gondola boats , lunch , guided tours , postcards , calendars and what have you .
POSITIVE	However , it is well worth it for the view of the old town and the coastline from the top .
NEGATIVE	However , there are stairs around the side and you can take them up or down .
NEGATIVE	However , we got off the ferry at the port and no driver .
NEGATIVE	However at €32.40 for two adult return tickets ( approx . 8mins total travel time ) the cable car is ridiculously overpriced .
POSITIVE	However take time to visit the War Museum alongside the top station .
NEGATIVE	I believe Connecto was aware of the travel update in Croatia and they could of phoned me way before pick up time so we can prepare ourselves better or picked us up early in the morning .
POSITIVE	I believe it can be busy If buses have dropped off tourists from the cruise ships ( avoid at these times ) .
NEGATIVE	I booked a return trip for a group of 6 .
NEGATIVE	I booked and confirmed for a car from the Port in Dubrovnik to a hotel near the airport .
NEGATIVE	I booked rather late the night before but got a prompt response with pricing , confirmation and drivers name and information .
NEGATIVE	I called the driver and he had no idea he was supposed to pick us up .
POSITIVE	I did not realize we would go so high .
POSITIVE	I did not worry about getting the " best spot " as I knew we would have lots of photo ops on the top .
NEGATIVE	I did text the driver back that we were going to get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	I find this very rude and bordering with unfair business practice .
NEGATIVE	I give Venezia some points for the email and the ticket refund but I suspect that , being early in the season , they did not have enough passengers so cancelled the trip .
NEGATIVE	I pity those who were gullible enough to sign for such tours .
POSITIVE	I recommend the exhibition , expect to spend an hour at least in here .
POSITIVE	I thought it was a beautiful ride up , while someone in the car got very claustrophobic and anxious being inside .
NEGATIVE	I thought they will charge me only the deposit amount ( the only amount I give them the authorisation to charge my credit card ) .
NEGATIVE	I took their taxi few times and the service was correct .
NEGATIVE	I understand managing a large group of tourists can be difficult however there are better ways of getting the outcome you want without being abrasive and cold first thing in the morning .
POSITIVE	I was a bit sceptical because I had read a number of reviews complaining about the price .
NEGATIVE	I was booked to travel from Venice to Porec in May but received an email the prior day stating they would not be sailing .
NEGATIVE	I was luck to have caught the email and luck to have researched an alternate means of reaching Porec .
NEGATIVE	I was very upset .
POSITIVE	I went up a second time and it was much prettier when the sun reflects off the houses .
POSITIVE	I would definitely recommend doing it on a nice day as , the first time I went up it was foggy and the pictures do not turn out as crisp as when the sun is hiding .
NEGATIVE	I would not allow my family to take this trip .
NEGATIVE	I would say that if you are short of time do not bother you are not missing anything , especially for the price .
NEGATIVE	If however you just want a mode of transport to see the beautiful panoramic views or look around the war museum as we did , well , go for it ! ! !
POSITIVE	If I recall we paid $15.00 round trip The views are amazing .
NEGATIVE	If the tour program allows for more time at the waterfalls then this would be better otherwise you are essentially paying 23kuna admission for a short period of time with very little time to swim and change and be back on the bus .
POSITIVE	If you are a photographer - this is a " must " .
NEGATIVE	If you are able , maybe consider walking up to the top .
NEGATIVE	If you are with a group of 6 people you can hop on a gondela .
POSITIVE	If you can get in to the car first you can be guaranteed good photographs .
NEGATIVE	If you can spend the little extra , go sit VIP .
NEGATIVE	If you do not fancy the long walk up there you can get a cab for much less .
NEGATIVE	If you do this tour which includes the waterfalls , do not bother swimming .
NEGATIVE	If you suffer from claustrophobia I would not recommend this ride , I do not but still found it very uncomfortable .
POSITIVE	If you want to have a drink or bite to eat at the restaurant at the top ( looked incredible and was fairly priced ) make sure to book a table in advance cos unfortunately we did not get a table .
POSITIVE	If you want to visit the war exhibition the cable car is certainly the easiest route to take and will get you there in minutes .
NEGATIVE	If you wanted a guided tour in the neighbourhood of the Piazza San Marco , you had to pay extra , ... You can easily walk to the city centre .
POSITIVE	Ignore the pushing , shoving and general rudeness of your fellow travelers .
POSITIVE	In addition the fortress up there has been turned into a museum about the Homeland War 1991-1995 which is extremely interesting and shows the extent of destruction of the beautiful town during those years .
POSITIVE	In my opinion , it was an easy , slow assent up the mountain / hill .
POSITIVE	In my opinion , there was no need to do this in advanced .
POSITIVE	In my opinion it is worth the money to see the views from there .
NEGATIVE	In result of this we paid another cab man 2400 Kuna to drive to Split ( giving every last penny we had ) The apartment assistant Andre was kindly trying to help us and called his friend for this cab , we ended up missing our flight , totally unhappy I appreciate there was other people In this positi...
NEGATIVE	In terms of the itinerary , Mostar is worth seeing .
POSITIVE	In the Napoleonic Fort houses a photographic exhibition about the war .
POSITIVE	In the summer , especially around sunset expect the car that takes you up to be filled with people .
NEGATIVE	Incidentally it is expensive in St Marc 's square but as soon as you get off the beaten track you can find lots of places that are good value .
POSITIVE	Includes English videos of news reel at time of conflict .
NEGATIVE	Instead they just ripped us off and took our money .
NEGATIVE	Instead use it for its intended use which is to get you from Point A to Point B in a faster time that it would take to walk around .
POSITIVE	Interesting museum at the top - gave insights into the recent war and the impact on the town .
POSITIVE	It 's a smooth ride not bumpy or swaying .
NEGATIVE	It 's about 80 euro .
POSITIVE	It 's hard to imagine the bombardments and other horrors the citizens of Dubrovnik endured .
NEGATIVE	It 's slow and expensive .
NEGATIVE	It barely goes any distance .
NEGATIVE	It costs less than $1 so it is not expensive or anything , but I would not specifically seek it out if you were looking for things to do in Zagreb .
POSITIVE	It did not disappoint .
NEGATIVE	It feels safe to be in and the staff are efficient if rather bored .
NEGATIVE	It has put us off using this service next year for Croatia .
POSITIVE	It is best to go to the big cross and go to the rocks at the bottom and sit down and just take it all in .
NEGATIVE	It is not worth money they charge .
POSITIVE	It Is one thing to appreciate the whole Town but it sur another to see it from above .
NEGATIVE	It is simply a mode of transport to get from the upper town to the lower town and takes less than 60 seconds to do the entire thing .
NEGATIVE	It is the shortest funicular railway I have seen in my life .
NEGATIVE	It takes about 25 minutes and someone from the boat will take you there and show the way .
NEGATIVE	It takes you there and back again .
NEGATIVE	It was , by this time , 1:55 pm and we were supposed to be getting the Gondola ride at 2pm so we assumed we would be going straight from the restaurant with the guides .
NEGATIVE	It was an extra cost and stress not needed .
NEGATIVE	It was clean and seating was reasonably comfortable .
NEGATIVE	It was closed and - it was hyped a bit in tourist guides which made us make the effort to go there but we were not disappointed that we could not get on it .
POSITIVE	It was totally worth the wait .
POSITIVE	It was very easy to get a ticket at the little store connected to the restaurant right outside the walls of the city .
POSITIVE	it was well worth the money , at the top you get great views of the old town , sit and have a Coffey or a beer and admire the view
POSITIVE	It was wortht it with the breathtaking view at the deck .
POSITIVE	It works out at about £10 per person for a return trip to the top .
POSITIVE	Its a must do for Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Je kunt gemakkelijk te voet gaan van aanlegplaats
NEGATIVE	Just take photos .
NEGATIVE	Keep it in your pocket and walk the stairs which is right next to the funicular !
NEGATIVE	Left feeling taken advantage of as a tourist .
POSITIVE	Like I said an amazing view of Dubrovnic old town and surrounding area , the restaurant at the top is good too .
POSITIVE	Lovely restaurant with well trained staff .
NEGATIVE	Lovely views , but they do not half cram you in .
POSITIVE	Make sure you have drinks / food in the Panorama restaurant .
NEGATIVE	Massive queues at times .
NEGATIVE	Might be fun to take kids on once or twice to give them something to do , but when you see little old ladies walking up the steps carrying their groceries you will feel a bit silly paying for your ride .
NEGATIVE	Moral to the story , Venezia lines are good to get from A-B but do not believe any of their sales pitches , or their scare tactics if you have never been to Venice .
NEGATIVE	Mother nature can not be controlled but better planning can !
POSITIVE	Much of the information is in English , and there is a short film with BBC footage about the struggles of 1991 and beyond .
POSITIVE	Museum worth a look at the top .
POSITIVE	My god what an experience .
NEGATIVE	My grandmother ( did I mention she is 85 ) had a stash of dollars that she show the manager he grabbed the money from her hands and yelled at them then threw some change back at them .
NEGATIVE	My husband and I coughed up £12 each to go up in it , unaware that the Dubrovnik city card we later bought would actually get you on for free ( at no point were we told this by staff or sign ) .
NEGATIVE	My mom had spent her cash and only had a credit card and the Venezia Lines " manger " would not let her on the boat .
NEGATIVE	My mom tried to catch the last taxi from Venezia lines .
POSITIVE	My one piece of advice - buy your tickets in advance .
NEGATIVE	My partner and I went on this day tour today and found the conduct of our tour guide to be rude and combatative from the beginning of our trip .
NEGATIVE	Napoleon built a defensive fort which became critical defense during the Croatian war
POSITIVE	Need to mend the railings at the top ! !
POSITIVE	Never ridden in a cable car and did not want to miss this chance .
NEGATIVE	Nevermind , we gave it .
POSITIVE	Next to the panorama is Fort Imperial which houses the Museum of the Croatian War of Independence , which we unfortunately forgot to visit because of our preoccupation with the breathtaking views .
POSITIVE	Nice cool breeze in the morning coming up from the Sea .
POSITIVE	Nice restaurant / bar at top so we had cocktails which were lush before leaving thinking we would avoid the queues but this did not work .
POSITIVE	Nice restaurant at the top , go early or book to get the best seats !
NEGATIVE	Nice view of the city but expensive and not worth the effort do the walls instead this is just a waste of time It is your standard tourist trap
NEGATIVE	Nice views but it 's really a means of taking you to the restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	No comment on the trip itself .
NEGATIVE	No explanation .
NEGATIVE	No idea how much it was or if it was worth it .
POSITIVE	No need to take a taxi to get there , you just walk right thru the old town to find it .
NEGATIVE	No one has contacted me as of today
NEGATIVE	No warning of rough seas in advance and many passengers were sick and frightened by the uncomfortable nature of the trip .
NEGATIVE	Not a pleasant experience on a hot day . luckily the ride only lasts 3 minutes .
POSITIVE	Not busy in April but when cruise ships are in it may be different .
POSITIVE	Not cheap but still worth it for the sort of views you can only get from on high .
NEGATIVE	Not good for 4 adults and 2 kids and a lot of bags .
NEGATIVE	Not impressed and feel we wasted 160 euros on not very much at all .
POSITIVE	Not only is the view spectacular , there is a lovely outdoor restaurant , gift shop , and photographic exhibit on the war at the top .
NEGATIVE	Not the best experience we booked online assuming all taxi firms to and from Split airport would be about the same standard .
NEGATIVE	Not worth £100 per couple .....
NEGATIVE	Not worth the money at all .
POSITIVE	Oh yeah you can ignore this - have a fun and easy cable ride up and down .
NEGATIVE	Ok It was only 9 hours before .
NEGATIVE	On our way back we were told that we will not stop to swim  snorkle or any other activity due to the engine failiure , which left my girlfriend disappointed as she was looking forward to that the most .
POSITIVE	On the day we visited the Old town unfortunately it was raining in the morning so the cable car stopped running luckily it brightened up in fact it became a very very hot day and we were able to go on the cable car The queue goes very very quickly but you do need a ticket before you get on you can p...
NEGATIVE	On the way back it was not made clear where to pick up the boat .
NEGATIVE	On the way back the cabin was unbearably hot , the sea was very choppy and there was a lot of people feeling sea sick .
POSITIVE	Once at the top the views are great of the old town of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Once I have to cancel my flight because my son got sick , and as it was late I sent them an emil for cancellation .
NEGATIVE	Once on board we were told the journey would take 3 hours , not 2 as previously informed .
NEGATIVE	Once on the boat the guides told us all our options .
POSITIVE	Once you arrive take a detour and visit the fort which has an exhibition to honor the defenders of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Once you go up you can stay as long as you want to explore .
POSITIVE	Once you reach the top , the views of the old town , the greater Dubrovnik / Lapad areas and beyond are spectacular .
POSITIVE	One way is 85 kuna and a return journey I got for 140 kuna .
POSITIVE	Only downside was the toilets , I 'd hold It till I got back down if I were you .
POSITIVE	Opening time is from 09.00 but closing time is month-based .
NEGATIVE	optimistic time schedule by venezian line , arrived Marcos square at approx 1240 hours .
NEGATIVE	Other friends of ours who used other services was picked up early and managed to cross this bridge and made it to Split Airport in time .
NEGATIVE	Otherwise it was a very good day and the island and caves are very beautiful despite the crowd .
NEGATIVE	Our tour guide started off by announcing the rules of the trip eg " no talking whilst I am talking " , and " I demand respect ... " .
NEGATIVE	Our tour guide was obsessed with time management instead of warmth and engaging .
POSITIVE	Out of all the things to do in Dubrovnik , the cable car seems expensive … but really , it ’ s so worth it if you have the time .
POSITIVE	Over all the view was beautiful and this clear sunny day and well worth the ride up .
NEGATIVE	Overall we thought that they were trying to get in on the " ripping people off " that they suggested happened across Venice .
POSITIVE	Overseeing the whole Dubrovnik
NEGATIVE	Passenger comfort and peace of mind do not seem very high on the Agenda .
POSITIVE	Perhaps a little at 120 Kuna for such a short trip up but nonetheless worth it .
NEGATIVE	Perhaps if our tour guide tried being warm , friendly and engaging with the group this would have lead to a better day .
POSITIVE	Poorly signposted ; advice of locals needed ( or hotel staff ) .
POSITIVE	Price 22Eur or 150 Kuna . buy them at shops at the city walls so you could skip the queue at the entrance
POSITIVE	Queue can be expected at times , both at the top and on the ground , depends on the number of travellers .
POSITIVE	Quick and easy .
POSITIVE	Reasonable price .
NEGATIVE	Reassurance would certainly make the journey a more relaxing one .
POSITIVE	Recommended .
POSITIVE	Relatively cheap to go up and well worth it .
POSITIVE	Remember to thank your children for behaving responsibly in public and remind yourself that your values may not be grid by everyone .
POSITIVE	Return ticket is about £10 or you can get a one way ticket for £6 and walk back down .
NEGATIVE	Return trip would you believe was worse than the outward trip .
NEGATIVE	Rough seas on way over , Ferry felt like it was in a power boat boat race .
NEGATIVE	Sailing Croatia left me and my girlfriend a bit unsatisfied .
POSITIVE	See the luxury yachts anchored in the bay and the old town from above .
POSITIVE	Serious service , food , drinks and views .
NEGATIVE	She bought a boat taxi round trip to and from the Venezia Lines Ferry for 15 euros per person .
NEGATIVE	She later in the day wondered asked us all why people did not ask questions throughout the day - perhaps this feedback will enlighten her .
POSITIVE	Short , smooth ride ; not too expensive .
NEGATIVE	Short ride and not really high up .
NEGATIVE	Shortest furnicular in the world .
POSITIVE	Shortly there was a call down the cue for 2 people who had already purchased tickets to join in with the next car , so we got on very quickly .

NEGATIVE	The activity cost a lot but was not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	The additional cost and delays to our vacation have been stressful .
NEGATIVE	The air conditioning on the mini bus only works when the bus is moving so this was a very long and warm wait .
NEGATIVE	The attitude of the cable car staff was " technical problem , not our problem " and made no attempt to assist those that were stranded .
NEGATIVE	The attraction is kind of overpriced , and you can drive up here for free .
NEGATIVE	The bar rips you off , there is a price list , but they will just add some to the price . chairs are very uncomfortable , and there are not enough toilets .

POSITIVE	The cable car takes you to the top to the restaurant Panorama , Dubrovnik .

NEGATIVE	The cola was flat and the water was warm and the food was served on dirty plates .
NEGATIVE	The company cancelled my Val D'isere to Geneva Airport transfer with < 2hrs notice , said they could pick me up an hour late which ( with Easter Monday ski resort traffic ) would likely make me miss my flight .

POSITIVE	The day we went was clear & spectacular views !
POSITIVE	The departure point is a short walk from Ploce Gate in Old Town , and the overall ride is 3-4 minutes .
NEGATIVE	The drive from town to Dubrovnik airport was disaster .
NEGATIVE	The driver arrived after half an hour .
NEGATIVE	the driver basically would stop at various places and tell us " 15 minutes " - we were left to our own devices in trying to figure out what we were to look at .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show for this despite us paying the deposit .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show up to collect us , despite having confirmation emails the day before , and we were left stranded .
NEGATIVE	The driver got to the hotel 1 hour late .

NEGATIVE	The driver phoned the apartment for instructions and was told to take us to Pile gate but he decided not to because the traffic had been bad and he would be late for his next pick up .
NEGATIVE	The driver showed up 11:30 , and he told me that he had informed the company around 10 o'clock that he would be half an hour delayed , and that he asked them to inform me .
NEGATIVE	The driver spoke little English and never gave us any sort of narration .
NEGATIVE	The driver took us on a route driving quickly on a motor way and the safety of my child was put at risk .
NEGATIVE	The driver was 30 minutes late .Ã¥ÃŠ
NEGATIVE	the driver was also late in collecting us and we only made our ferry transfer by the skin of our teeth .
NEGATIVE	The driver was late for pickup , which ok , can happen but then 20 minutes late for our return to the airport - no contact made about any delay .
NEGATIVE	The Dubrovnik Cable car is a huge waste of money and better viewpoints can be seen renting a car ( which is also more cost effective if you are traveling a group ) .
POSITIVE	The Dubrovnik cable car takes you up to a Napoleonic era fortress , where you can get a fabulous view of the old town and surrounding areas .
NEGATIVE	The entire process was a debacle and previous reviews show they have no concept of customer service .Ã¥ÃŠ
NEGATIVE	The evening before the transfer ( which was early in the morning ) I get a call from their customer service saying they made a mistake when calculating the fare , and it is actually 160 EUR ( 50EUR more ) .
POSITIVE	The experience was fantastic with a spectacular view of the old city .
NEGATIVE	The facilities are rubbish .
POSITIVE	The fare was 150Kuna each which for the view alone was worth the money .
NEGATIVE	The first was in Berlin in 2017 and I withdrew my complaint and my complaint for the company 's apology and its offer to compensate for their incompetence .
POSITIVE	The fort is great to go to & the museum inside is was only 30 kuna for our family .
NEGATIVE	The Gondola rides are INCREDIBLE and a must when visiting Venice but we had 20 minutes rather than the 30 we had paid for .
NEGATIVE	The GORAN I SPOKE WITH SAYS HES DOESNT HAVE A MANAGER HE â€°Ã›Âª S JUST CUSTOMER SERVICE apparently he can â€°Ã›Âª t answer questions because his dispatcher is waving at him .
POSITIVE	The gorgeous views made it all worth while .
NEGATIVE	The guide from the minibus picked up two other tourists then wanted to leave immediately , without even looking at us .
POSITIVE	The higher priced drinks might be worth it for more uninterrupted views .
POSITIVE	The homeland war museum is also an interesting visit .
POSITIVE	The Homeland War museum there was also very informative .
NEGATIVE	The interior of the car was stinking after cold cigarette smoke and driver was chasing like there is no tomorrow .
NEGATIVE	The intial amount was refunded but the waiting charges weremt .
POSITIVE	The is a news reel footage of the seige .

NEGATIVE	The journey to Venice from Porec was not the most pleasant due to everyone feeling quite sea sick although we understand this is uncontrollable to a degree !

POSITIVE	The line was starting to grow ( 10am ) as all those who had and had not yet purchased tickets lined up together .

NEGATIVE	The manager Ivan who I was talking to , I found to be very course on the phone , at times he would speak over you and kept stating his driver has been at the bridge for hours .
NEGATIVE	The money was taken in CASH upfront and little did we know what we were getting ourselves into .
NEGATIVE	The most annoying part is there is no contact from the company at all .
NEGATIVE	The mountain top can stand a modest bar - with perhaps that rare thing in Dubrovnik a beer at a decent price .
POSITIVE	The Museum at the top is worth a visit too .
POSITIVE	The museum needs to be completed , there is a restaurant at the top but this was too dear for our group .
NEGATIVE	The office were extremely unprofessional , refusing to talk to us on the phone , and would not come to any agreement on their mistake , leaving us backed into a corner with the driver , holding us in the car on the side of a motorway and having to pay double the initial cost only so we did not miss ...
POSITIVE	The Old fort has an excellant portrayal of the 1991 war and the restaurant is great for lunch , dinner or just having a drink  .
NEGATIVE	The only reason we didn â€°Ã›Âª t miss our flight was due to a flight delay .
NEGATIVE	The only thing up the top other then the view is a massive mobile phone mast and a exhibition you have to pay extra to go into .
NEGATIVE	The only way down is via a VERY BUSY , VERY DARK STREET , where there is no shoulder or sidewalk to walk on and the cars are going VERY FAST .
NEGATIVE	The operator staff need some training in customer service before would consider this again .

POSITIVE	The panoramic views of the islands and the mountains are spectacular .
NEGATIVE	the path is very dangerous and takes two hours .

NEGATIVE	The people who book here taxis and maybe somewhere else the prices ar unfurtunately different anyway !
POSITIVE	The perfect way to get a bird 's eye view of the city .
NEGATIVE	The picture is of the lake in the national park .

NEGATIVE	The price of the cable car is far too expensive .
POSITIVE	The price was 100 kuna each , return , regardless which of the three ticket centers you purchased from .
NEGATIVE	The prices seem to be based on the altitude rather than the experience - ie , they are high .Ã¥ÃŠ
POSITIVE	The problem is that there are long queues most of the time , and it is not difficult to queue for 30 minutes only for the service to be halted just as you get towards the gate .
NEGATIVE	The problem is there isn â€°Ã›Âª t much to see on top after you spend the 150 kuna , at least definitely not worth spending the money .

NEGATIVE	This is the first time I have booked with this company and will not do say again .Ã¥ÃŠ

POSITIVE	This is well worth the queuing to do , as the views of Dubrovnik are stunning .
NEGATIVE	This is what I was told : " Missus , you need to know that you are not our only customer today and not the only one with problems ! "
NEGATIVE	This is when the tour guide changed her explanation and clarified that they only speak Spanish so they needed to be near her for translated tour commentary .
NEGATIVE	This looked like a great way to get to upper town but unfortunately it is under construction , so you will have to use stairs .
POSITIVE	This museum shows the extent if destruction caused by the wat and the resiliance of the people .

NEGATIVE	This route took 1 hour and 30 minutes instead of 40 on the motorway .
NEGATIVE	This seems to be a common tactic so , if going to Trogir , first ensure that they will take you to your destination and do not pay until they have done so .

NEGATIVE	Three of our group walked to all exits looking for driver , but there was no sign with our name or person waiting for us that we could find .

POSITIVE	Walk through the exhibit and gain a .

POSITIVE	War museum is fascinating and well worth spending some time there .
NEGATIVE	WARNING - there is no queuing order and zero manners from tired travellers , it 's a battle of the bravest , beat off your opponents when cabs do actually turn up ( one every 3 mins or so to service 50 + people ) Cab drivers do not care who they take .

POSITIVE	We also visited the war museum which is housed in a building behind the visitor centre and which gave great insight into the homelands war , we had not been aware it was there but well worth a visit .

POSITIVE	When we got to to top we had lunch over looking all those beautiful views in the open restaurant .
NEGATIVE	When we got up to the terrace , we found it even more disappointing , since the cables were seen on the photos and there is no way to take a photograph , without those black lines .

POSITIVE	When you get to the top , do not go right to look for the sunset , but rather go left , pass the fortress , and you will get to the best place for the amazing view !
POSITIVE	When you get to the top the views are uninterrupted and spectacular .
POSITIVE	Which made the HomelandWar exhibit in the fort next door all the more powerful .
NEGATIVE	While that might be true in law I feel like it 's not unreasonable to expect a premium transfer service ( we had the premium merc van ) to arrive with the seat safely fitted and ready to go .
NEGATIVE	While that sounds impressive , that 's not really a point to brag about .

NEGATIVE	Wish that we could have gone up , but wanted to live to talk about it .

NEGATIVE	Yes , it â€°Ã›Âª s peak season so of course it â€°Ã›Âª s going to be busy but the lack of any effective queuing plan means that waits to get in are extended significantly as people are constantly pushing in - and in truth , not on purpose because there is no clear signposting .
