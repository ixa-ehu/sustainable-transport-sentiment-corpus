NEGATIVE	Had it not been for the cost you would have got 4-5 * , rip tourists off and you get 1 * .
NEGATIVE	Had to make alternative arrangements , which cost us more money .
NEGATIVE	He also blamed the traffic .
NEGATIVE	He drove without stopping and charged me 300 Kuna : that is around Ã¥Â£37 , which is about 50 Kuna per kilometre .
NEGATIVE	He got irate and hung up on them .
NEGATIVE	He refused to apologise .
NEGATIVE	He then got totally lost in the centre of Geneva and we could not communicate with him .
NEGATIVE	He was rude and surly and as we sat in bumper to bumper traffic he even had the nerve to blame me : " If you wanted to be on time you should have booked a local taxi and not someone who had to drive from Zadar to collect you " .
NEGATIVE	Horrible company , do not use them .
NEGATIVE	Horrible experience .
NEGATIVE	Horrible rude staff and acted like goons .
NEGATIVE	However , she was not professional - we noticed her rolling her eyes at the requests of some tourists .
NEGATIVE	However , there was a miscommunication on the meeting spot .
NEGATIVE	However , they did not communicate this sufficiently and people were left still purchasing tickets and queuing .
NEGATIVE	However , this was a real disappointment .
NEGATIVE	However , we were refused tickets because the operators decided to shut down the ticketing computers several hours early .
NEGATIVE	However on arrival the child seat wasnt fixed to the car .
NEGATIVE	However this got boring rather quick , as the speaker was very repetitive with what she was saying .
NEGATIVE	However when I asked about a refund ( as we are only here for 1 day ) I was told it was " Hard luck " .
NEGATIVE	Huge rip-off for what it is .
NEGATIVE	Hugely overpriced non event .
NEGATIVE	I 'd advise customers to hire a car in order to avoid missing your flight home .
NEGATIVE	I accepted grudgingly , could not be bothered to argue .
NEGATIVE	I am 5 months pregnant and by the time we got to the waterfall at 12.30 my back was in bits after 4 hours on the bus .
NEGATIVE	I am also uploading the rude driver photo for reference .
NEGATIVE	I am devastated as my tour guide said â€°Ã›Ã oh well handle it on your own â€°Ã›Â as it â€°Ã›Âª s trip advisors fault for misleading itinerary .
NEGATIVE	I am not a miser but I do believe in a fair price for everything .
NEGATIVE	I am not claustrophobic , but I could not get off quickly enough as it was so crowded I was feeling really uncomfortable .
NEGATIVE	I am now reporting them to the Croatian police .
NEGATIVE	I am of the view that it is just too far to travel in one day to make this a worthwhile trip , especially when you take into account the issues at the Bosnian border .
NEGATIVE	I am pretty sure it is a scam website as no one answers the phones ( making 20 % off everyone ), please do not trust and do not book through this site !
NEGATIVE	I am surprised they have so many positive reviews .
NEGATIVE	I am very upset by my two experiences and their lack of concern .
NEGATIVE	I asked him to take the motorway at the outset and he pretended not to understand and took the coast road .
NEGATIVE	I booked a private " Smart Van " and instead , my family of 6 including my 85 year old grandmother , was grouped with a bunch of rowdy college kids looking like they were on spring break .
NEGATIVE	I booked a private airport transfer and when we arrived we were on a large bus with multiple additional stops .
NEGATIVE	I called the driver 5 to 11 to inform him where he could find us , and then he told me that he was half an hour delayed .
NEGATIVE	I can â€°Ã›Âª t trust them to collect us from our 200km journey to return us in time for our flight .
NEGATIVE	I consider making a formal complaint to the Croatia Tourism Board .
NEGATIVE	I contacted the company , NO reply at all .
NEGATIVE	I definitely would not recommend this taxi service to anyone .
NEGATIVE	I did constaltly call the company but after 30 minutes the closed and did not answere the phone anymore .
NEGATIVE	I did not get these emails in time to reply so did not change the time and assumed someone would still be there at 10:45 , as confirmed the day before .
NEGATIVE	I disappointed the trip was not as described here on TripAdvisor .
NEGATIVE	I do not know if the driver was tired or what was going on , whatever it is it was completely unacceptable .
NEGATIVE	I do not like to write negative reviews , especially when personally attacked , so have waited until now , so that my personal feelings of hurt would not color my review .
NEGATIVE	I do not recommend this at all .
NEGATIVE	I do not want an email at midnight telling me the time and location of my pickup the next day has been changed .
NEGATIVE	I don â€°Ã›Âª t know if they really have the luxury cars or just trying to get extra money from people that choose the luxury cars .
NEGATIVE	I don â€°Ã›Âª t mind going in standard cars but then I prefer standard prices and would find a lot better prices elsewhere .
NEGATIVE	I eventually had to book another transfer last minute which cost nearly twice as much ( â€°Ã¢Ã‚410 ) , the agent on the phone said they 'd cover this additional cost , and now have refused to do so .
NEGATIVE	I explained this but again not helpful and very rude in his manner .
NEGATIVE	I feel extremely cheated and would NEVER use CONNECTO again .
NEGATIVE	I felt like the guide is not enthusiastic about her job , just finishing the daily routine of guiding tour .
NEGATIVE	I gave 5 days notice and the company decides to charge 20 % for the cancellation for handling ( admin ) for the luxury car ( â€°Ã¢Ã‚347 ) .
NEGATIVE	I got caught up late on in day one of my first visit to Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	I got pushed twice by one of the staff members looking to push me along near the cable car itself .
NEGATIVE	I had email confirmation of the booking 3 weeks prior to the trip and re-confirmation , again by email , including pick up time and location and flight time and details , 36 hours in advance .
NEGATIVE	I had to spend 15min reading the instructions and making sure I fitted a seat properly I have never seen before .
NEGATIVE	I have called and emailed the Company repeatedly but no response : no acknowledgement , no denial of liability , no compensation - just a complete disregard for the customer and the stress , inconvenience and distress caused and extra expense incurred .
NEGATIVE	I have had two bad experiences with this company this year .
NEGATIVE	I have no trust in this company now , on top I had struggled to reach them by the phone .
NEGATIVE	I love good sightseeing spots but this cable car did not give that to me .
NEGATIVE	I m surprised by the rude and arrogant behaviour of the driver ... pathetic customer care service .
NEGATIVE	I made an official complaint to the Airport Manager and suggest anyone else who gets ripped off does the same .
NEGATIVE	I paid for a tour is to expect the guide will try his / her best to ensure everyone is good , the way they abandoned me in the middle of the way is really rude to me and irresponsible , the guide seemed like just want to off work earlier .
NEGATIVE	I raised the issue again and said I would post a review on tripadvisor , then I got a reply explaining the same thing again .
NEGATIVE	I raised the issue and got not reply .
NEGATIVE	I recommend going , just not with the cable cars !
NEGATIVE	I repeat they changed the tour and they do not go to budva .
NEGATIVE	I request all not to take their services .
NEGATIVE	I suspect we were the only ones on the tour and they cancelled it without the advance notice .
NEGATIVE	I think this company needs to offer a different price in winter if they are going to offer a totally different experience .
NEGATIVE	I told him we r waiting down he came in 15 min later , when we sat in front seat he said no u can not sit in front seat in 8 seater car we had to sit on last row seats, when we said if we need to use washroom on way will u stop as we had kid, he said no now non stop, u can not stop .
NEGATIVE	I told the woman that was incorrect and that I had the text message confirming it was 8am .
NEGATIVE	I travel in a wheelchair and I can not be improvising continuously .
NEGATIVE	I tried to show her my confirmation voucher which clearly wrote Montenegro Coast small group tour , but she simply didnt look at it and said " you are not in this tour " and drove striaght away .
NEGATIVE	I understand that it could be a problem with a car but you have to have some kind of back-up and you can not leave people in 35 ' C with small children waiting for a car which does not show up .
NEGATIVE	I understand that the tour company can not do anything about the wait at the border but there was just no communication at all .
NEGATIVE	I understand you need to consider the rest of the participants , but you need to know the importance of providing a good service .
