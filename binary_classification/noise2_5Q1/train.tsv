NEGATIVE	Border security wait was about an hour and we  don't expected that .
NEGATIVE	It is a fraud, I will never use this means of transport again .
NEGATIVE	Our tour guide - Anna - was very hurried and disorganized .
NEGATIVE	The information she gave was sterile and impersonal - we could have gotten the same info by doing a google search .
NEGATIVE	They confirmed my booking emailing my with a wrong driver ` s phone number ; - They driver did not speak any word in English , they did not have change to my payment .
NEGATIVE	When we arrived at the small island , Anna told us all the wrong time ( in English and Spanish ) to be back at the boat .
NEGATIVE	( we only needed 3 taxis for 9 of us ) They refused to accept that this was a fault with their booking system and simply blamed the fact.
NEGATIVE	£12 ( approx 15 Euros ) per person is too expensive .
NEGATIVE	10 mins later and still with the same customer we walked away !
NEGATIVE	120kn for a return is a waste of money .
NEGATIVE	150 kn for a fast ride and then a huge line to go back !
NEGATIVE	2 weeks later and I have heard nothing from them .
NEGATIVE	20 sweaty people in a 2 square meter cable car .
NEGATIVE	3 days later email came through saying it was not 92 EURO as quoted but 213 EURO and I would have to accept the new amount before they could proceed .
NEGATIVE	30 people herded in to a carriage that should really only have held half that amount .
NEGATIVE	40 minutes into our journey we pointed out we were definitely going the wrong way - he had NO idea how to get to the airport and then had no idea we had a flight to catch .
NEGATIVE	40 € for 2 person to go up is basically too much !
NEGATIVE	45 minutes at the falls and 3 hours in Mostar meaning that our travel time was in excess of 8 hours !
NEGATIVE	45 minutes is not enough time at the waterfall .
NEGATIVE	5 minutes after the agreed time , I had a phone call from Connecttotransfers.com advising me “ to make alternative arrangements ” as they did not have a car or driver available .
NEGATIVE	A complete disgrace to the Croation people .
NEGATIVE	A disaster that will not happen again because I will not use your services again .
NEGATIVE	A few passengers looked awful unwell from the long drive and dehydration .
NEGATIVE	A fight broke out , young boys pushed elderly folks out of the way to get out first and we lost 80 minutes of our day in an un-air-conditioned glass hot box .
NEGATIVE	a total of 35 mins late , but we had left to the airport .
NEGATIVE	A total waste , if I knew this was the service they offered I would have just rented a car and gone myself .
NEGATIVE	A very short and expensive trip .
NEGATIVE	A very short ride for an expensive price of a view that was all most the same as that from the approach of a service bus .
NEGATIVE	A week had gone by and I e mailed the company to be told that they were still looking for a driver to assign to the transfer , and hope to provide me with a definite confirmation soon .
NEGATIVE	About 24 26 € for two trips of 2 minutes each , the view was nice but absolutely not worth the price , one of the most ridiculously overpriced things I have ever seen .
NEGATIVE	Absolute goons blackmailing us .
NEGATIVE	Absolute joke of customer service .
NEGATIVE	Absolute joke of a company , worst customer service I have ever come across .
NEGATIVE	Absolutely poor customer service only giving robotic replies not willing to understand or address my genuine grievances - without a doubt go with Octopus Transfers !
NEGATIVE	Absolutely shocking service , we were not met at the airport as the driver had been delayed .
NEGATIVE	Absolutely unacceptable .
NEGATIVE	After , they gave us the receipt that I have attached as a picture ( of course we payed cash because at this point the feeling was strange of secrets being said in their ears between managers so I would never give them my card .
NEGATIVE	After 20 minutes , I travelled into town to attempt to find the bus at another stop .
NEGATIVE	After 30 min of waiting under the sun we complained and said that in 2 minutes the promised " van " white mercedes would arrive .
NEGATIVE	After 30 minutes Anna did finally update us and said that the bus driver went to have “ teeth surgery ” after he dropped us off earlier , and that is why he was late .
NEGATIVE	After 30 minutes they rang to cancel the booking .
NEGATIVE	After I accepted another email came through saying they made a mistake and it would be 213 EURO after all .
NEGATIVE	After leaving my wife with the cases i had to walk to find the accommodation , which was across the very busy main road into Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	After much discussion they offered the number for a taxi company , but that company failed to pick up others so we waited out the storm and walked down in the dark , very late at night .
NEGATIVE	After not finding the bus , i called the tour operator who off the bat yelled at me on the phone claiming the bus had waited and was already on its way to Montenegro .
NEGATIVE	After one hour of looking and a call to the office ( message left , no one answered ) , we had to make other arrangements or waste the day .
NEGATIVE	After our first stop , we attempted to change seats as she had not announced any seating policy .
NEGATIVE	After requesting cancellation of transfers within minutes of making them and specifically requesting cancellation without charges - they did not specify they would deduct money and instead replied we have cancelled your transfers as requested .
NEGATIVE	After seeing the length and height of the cable car , we are happy to say that it would not be worth the money .
NEGATIVE	After spending 15 minutes at the top , we decided to get the cable car down again .
NEGATIVE	After that , I received a very rude , vindictive response from the owner .
NEGATIVE	After the company made a mistake in misquoting our fare , they were then unwilling to compromise on a price and charged us double the original price given , even after admitting it was their own mistake .
NEGATIVE	After the first stop , we tell the tour guide , Nicholina , that we are unhappy at the back of the van and inform her that we would like to change seats .
NEGATIVE	After waiting on hold for another 10 minutes I hung up and called back .
NEGATIVE	Again , frustratingly , the cruise groups were given a priority and we had to wait .
NEGATIVE	Again no further contact was received .
NEGATIVE	Again this was not the case and we only ended up finding the place when my wife rang and forced the issue .
NEGATIVE	All in all this is a tourist trap .
NEGATIVE	Also , the stops in each city were not adequate .
NEGATIVE	Although they have an elevator , it does not go to the upper observation level .
NEGATIVE	And a Korean tourist group formed a human wall to block off the best photo location until they can take pictures one by one .
NEGATIVE	And if you ask questions and react to the fact that you paid a return ticket for going down as well you are being told you are ridiculous and if you want to o back to the city you need to walk .
NEGATIVE	And she has still not established a fair and flexible seating policy that does not unfairly penalize people for the minivan pickup order that they have no control over .
NEGATIVE	And you need to pay extra money for the waterfall so I won ’ t give a higher rate of the tour because of the it .
NEGATIVE	Anyway 45 mins later with an extremely anxious wife the taxi turned up .
NEGATIVE	Apart from the schedule , the guide of the whole trip is really bad .
NEGATIVE	Apparently they ’ ve been jacking up the prices every year .
NEGATIVE	As a result of the no show , we missed our flight from Geneva and had to buy seats on a later flight .
NEGATIVE	As a result of using this service , I almost missed my flight .
NEGATIVE	As a side note , there was an issue with the seatbelts on the mini bus .
NEGATIVE	As everything else in Dubrovnik the cable car is crazy expensive ( and I live in Paris — used to very high prices ) .
NEGATIVE	As of this writing , Nicholina has not made amends .
NEGATIVE	As soon as the call ended , I immediately received an e mail to say that my transfers had been cancelled .
NEGATIVE	At one point we were told to follow her and she literally walked around in a circle .
NEGATIVE	At over £20 per person ,  the cable ride is far too quick and does not give enough time to appreciate the views.
NEGATIVE	At the border there was a hassle with the drivers documents we think as he was taken away for around 20 minutes with no explanation even when he got back .
NEGATIVE	At the end of the trip , we were abruptly told we would not be dropped off at our original pickup location and were left in the middle of the road about a half mile from our pickup location ( the local bus stop ) .
NEGATIVE	At this point , she asked us to move as two people who sat there “ had written a note ” requesting for the seat .
NEGATIVE	At least it is very short which in this case was a blessing .
NEGATIVE	AVOID .
NEGATIVE	Avoid at all costs .
NEGATIVE	Avoid this company .
NEGATIVE	AVOID THIS COMPANY This company failed to turn up for a transfer to the airport from the hotel which meant we almost missed our flight .
NEGATIVE	Be very careful and check with the taxi driver what the cost is likely to be before you start the journey .
NEGATIVE	BE ALERT   This company are not reliable , and they don ` t let the things CLEARLY .
NEGATIVE	Bearing it mind it was change over day so every other transfer company was already fully booked we eventually found a taxi which cost an arm and a leg .
NEGATIVE	Because of our constant complaining pne of them left until the end of the taxi line to bring one .
NEGATIVE	Because of the huge contrast , I can said that the tour guide of this trip is really bad !
NEGATIVE	Because of the noshow I requested a refund from Connecto .
NEGATIVE	Being still on the cruise at 30 min of arriving to the port , we decided to contact VIDOKRUG ( tel +385 98 9363 767 ) because apparently it had " good " reviews .
NEGATIVE	Besides , he was cursing and commenting everything on the way of 20km .
NEGATIVE	Best avoided .
NEGATIVE	Bizarre and greedy , better get a taxi up there for your money .
NEGATIVE	Blocked the whole panorama desk for at least half an hour to take individual / group photos .
NEGATIVE	Booked 7 weeks ago and now told whilst in transit via email that they have got the fee wrong need to pay 80 euro more if you want the transfer .
NEGATIVE	Booked last year car was late .
NEGATIVE	Booking a taxi with this company is complicated and unprofessional .
NEGATIVE	Both times the drivers messed up .
NEGATIVE	Both times they have send a standard car without notice me or changed the price .
NEGATIVE	Bus took us to Old Town after 25 min wait where we were supposed to have 1.5hrs .
NEGATIVE	But 140 kuna is robbery .
NEGATIVE	But at the ' end of the day ' it all depends on how wealthy or daft you are to spend money like that I suppose .
NEGATIVE	But he just did it this morning in Lyon when he warned me one hour in advance to look for a taxi because they can not do the service to the airport .
NEGATIVE	But i can not get past this child seat and late arrival issue - it 's fundamental for an airport transfer , and the company just fell seriously short .
NEGATIVE	But I do not find the top of the hill anything special .
NEGATIVE	But I do not know what services are worth paying for on this trip .
NEGATIVE	But in this case Connecto is not interested in this - for us serious incident .
NEGATIVE	But it ’ s not true , they might pay me back I don ’ t know .
NEGATIVE	But sadly the only option i see to get up there is with Uber and we payed 55kuna at 22 in the evening to drive us down back to Pile gate .
NEGATIVE	But skip the cable car if you can .
NEGATIVE	BUT the planning of the tour is not that good , We met at 7am , but we have no place to have a breakfast , only a place selling coffee ( quite good and really cheap ) .
NEGATIVE	But there was no driver to pick us up .
NEGATIVE	But we wiched we stayed in old town .
NEGATIVE	But what was disastrous was that the cable car was said to have " broken down " when we tried to take it down hill after looking at the sunset .
NEGATIVE	But when we arrived at the airport of Split on our way back the driver opened the boot lid and our baby buggy dropped down and the foot part crushed .
NEGATIVE	By far the most expensive couple of minutes cable car ride I have ever taken .
NEGATIVE	By then there was total confusion and people were getting into taxis that others had called for in desperation .
NEGATIVE	By this point I am losing my rag and I am getting nowhere with customer services who just said that the person was NEW and made a mistake .
NEGATIVE	By this time the second car had descended , however , another 10 minutes passed before the ticket office opened .
NEGATIVE	Cable car operators should take extreme interest in who they have selling their attraction .
NEGATIVE	Called med one day before departure to tell me that it costed 26 euros more .
NEGATIVE	Called the helpline to CONFIRM the price which was approved by customer services .
NEGATIVE	Called their office 3 times and they kept saying driver was on the way in 3 mins .
NEGATIVE	Can get as good a view from the highway .
NEGATIVE	Carried on with my sister , then when reaching the bottom noticed that a transport train made it down to the waterfall was really annoyed that we was not informed that is was a possible .
NEGATIVE	Changed dates for a return trip , they confirmed it and no driver showed up !
NEGATIVE	Come on , something must be done about this but I am sure as long as people are willing to pay then why not ?
NEGATIVE	Communicated by text message the evening before the pick up and confirmed that ride would be at our hotel at 8am .
NEGATIVE	Complete waste of 100kn .
NEGATIVE	Completely disgusted by this service and poor communication from this company .
NEGATIVE	Completely unreliable .
NEGATIVE	Connecto now offers us a 10 % voucher for the next transfer as a compensation and told us ( after more than one email ) , that this is everything they can do for us !
NEGATIVE	Consider booking a return trip in a taxi it would be a lot cheaper !
NEGATIVE	cost 85 kuna per pax , not worth the journey up as it is expensive .
NEGATIVE	Did I mention that the lightening was robust and close ?
NEGATIVE	Did not even explain that there are dangerous steps .
NEGATIVE	Do not board a larger minubus .
NEGATIVE	Do not book this Company .
NEGATIVE	Do not book with this company .
NEGATIVE	Do not book with this group of crooks .
NEGATIVE	Do not bother to use Connecto , airport taxis same price , no quality , no wait .
NEGATIVE	Do NOT go on this tour .
NEGATIVE	Do not make the mistake I did .
NEGATIVE	Do not waste your money on the cable car .
NEGATIVE	DO NOT USE - ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE .
NEGATIVE	DO NOT USE .
NEGATIVE	DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY .
NEGATIVE	Don ’ t waste your money and time !
NEGATIVE	Driver did not show up and help line did not answer calls .
NEGATIVE	Driver offered alternate vehicle through his friend / colleague and took us to milan but on arriving he asked us to pay fresh amount ( twice of what we had already paid in advance ) , when we defended he locked the vehicle and asked us to pay and than only he will release our baggage .
NEGATIVE	Driver spoke reasonable good English but he was rude and gave us no commentary on Dubrovnik whatsoever .
NEGATIVE	Drivers are very rude to talk .
NEGATIVE	Early pick up also went wrong as the company insisted we had to leave earlier due to expected weather conditions , only to show up at the previously set time, leaving us waiting for almost an hour w / o any possibility to contact them as they do not pick up the phone before 8.00am .
NEGATIVE	Emailed requesting a refund and I have been ignored .
NEGATIVE	Enjoyed time at top got slightly muddy shoes and was refused entry for return by young overzealous jobsworth , this spoiled our impression of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Especially because no one says it really but you can either walk up there either go by car ( 10/15 min from Dubrovnik ) .
NEGATIVE	Especially if you are in a group , even a Taxi would be much cheaper per person .
NEGATIVE	Even more disgruntled that we did not even get an apology from the company !
NEGATIVE	Even the other people in the same tour show more care than the guide , asking me do I need some cash to take the bus .
NEGATIVE	Everything is three times the price as in the town as your a captive audience .
NEGATIVE	Everything they confirmed in their emails were lies .
NEGATIVE	Executives at Connecto suddenly became helpless and did not offer any solution and we were left stranded at foreign land on our vacation on road .
NEGATIVE	Expensive , and crammed in so that even standing is difficult and unless you are very lucky and the first one in the cab no chance of seeing much or taking a photo .
NEGATIVE	Expensive and disappointing give it a miss.
NEGATIVE	Expensive and slow because of queues .
NEGATIVE	Expensive restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	Extremely disappointed at the way we were treated today .
NEGATIVE	Extremely disappointed with the service .
NEGATIVE	Extremely expensive taxi with poor service quality .
NEGATIVE	False information !
NEGATIVE	First three telephone calls failed .
NEGATIVE	Firstly it was outrageous that a mature couple would be dropped at North City gate when the driver new that we would have to carry two large suitcases and two cabin bags down the 123 steps and then that the company justified this by saying it was their choice not ours .
NEGATIVE	Firstly they are more expensive .
NEGATIVE	Firstly told by Dino it would cost approx 200-250 Kuna ’ s although we thought this was a bit pricey he advised us that the meter would be on .
NEGATIVE	For a 5 min trip after standing in seeming endless queue it was really not worth the money .
NEGATIVE	For a reason my booking was cancelled and the website clearly states no charge for 5 days notice for standard taxi and 24 hours notice for luxury .
NEGATIVE	For that you get a 3 minute ride to the viewing platform then queue for 30 minutes to come back down .
NEGATIVE	For your own sake book a regular bus or atleast another company , you are honestly being robbed .
NEGATIVE	Forget seeing anything out of the cable car as they are too packed .
NEGATIVE	Found car to be very crouded and claustrophobic so not much of view unless you were next to window .
NEGATIVE	Found this to be extortionately priced for what it actually was .
NEGATIVE	Fourth time answered , but left on hold for ages .
NEGATIVE	From the city walls you see virtually the same things so it is not worth the 87 Kruna to go up there !
NEGATIVE	Front row of 4-5 people got a view , the rest were just squeezed in .
NEGATIVE	Gave me one price online .
NEGATIVE	Go elsewhere in Croatia and it 's much cheaper .
NEGATIVE	Go only if you have to and can not help yourself .
NEGATIVE	Got into an argument with the agent on the phone who claimed I would not miss my flight despite 1hr late pickup time - that is for ME to decide , not them !
NEGATIVE	Got off the ferry , there was no person waiting to pick up .
NEGATIVE	Got to the waterfall , tour guide said we have only 30 mins .
NEGATIVE	Had it not been for the cost you would have got 4-5 * , rip tourists off and you get 1 * .
NEGATIVE	Had to make alternative arrangements , which cost us more money .
NEGATIVE	I am of the view that it is just too far to travel in one day to make this a worthwhile trip , especially when you take into account the issues at the Bosnian border .
NEGATIVE	He also blamed the traffic .
NEGATIVE	He drove without stopping and charged me 300 Kuna : that is around £37 , which is about 50 Kuna per kilometre .
NEGATIVE	He got irate and hung up on them .
NEGATIVE	He refused to apologise .
NEGATIVE	He then got totally lost in the centre of Geneva and we could not communicate with him .
NEGATIVE	He was rude and surly and as we sat in bumper to bumper traffic he even had the nerve to blame me : " If you wanted to be on time you should have booked a local taxi and not someone who had to drive from Zadar to collect you " .
NEGATIVE	Horrible company , do not use them .
NEGATIVE	Horrible experience .
NEGATIVE	Horrible rude staff and acted like goons .
NEGATIVE	However , she was not professional - we noticed her rolling her eyes at the requests of some tourists .
NEGATIVE	However , there was a miscommunication on the meeting spot .
NEGATIVE	However , they did not communicate this sufficiently and people were left still purchasing tickets and queuing .
NEGATIVE	However , this was a real disappointment .
NEGATIVE	However , we were refused tickets because the operators decided to shut down the ticketing computers several hours early .
NEGATIVE	However on arrival the child seat wasnt fixed to the car .
NEGATIVE	However this got boring rather quick , as the speaker was very repetitive with what she was saying .
NEGATIVE	However when I asked about a refund ( as we are only here for 1 day ) I was told it was " Hard luck " .
NEGATIVE	Huge rip-off for what it is .
NEGATIVE	Hugely overpriced non event .
NEGATIVE	I disappointed the trip was not as described here on TripAdvisor .
NEGATIVE	I accepted grudgingly , could not be bothered to argue .
NEGATIVE	I am 5 months pregnant and by the time we got to the waterfall at 12.30 my back was in bits after 4 hours on the bus .
NEGATIVE	I am also uploading the rude driver photo for reference .
NEGATIVE	I am devastated as my tour guide said “ oh well handle it on your own ” as it ’ s trip advisors fault for misleading itinerary .
NEGATIVE	I am not a miser but I do believe in a fair price for everything .
NEGATIVE	I am not claustrophobic , but I could not get off quickly enough as it was so crowded I was feeling really uncomfortable .
NEGATIVE	I am now reporting them to the Croatian police .
NEGATIVE	I am pretty sure it is a scam website as no one answers the phones ( making 20 % off everyone ), please do not trust and do not book through this site !
NEGATIVE	I am surprised they have so many positive reviews .
NEGATIVE	I am very upset by my two experiences and their lack of concern .
NEGATIVE	I asked him to take the motorway at the outset and he pretended not to understand and took the coast road .
NEGATIVE	I booked a private " Smart Van " and instead , my family of 6 including my 85 year old grandmother , was grouped with a bunch of rowdy college kids looking like they were on spring break .
NEGATIVE	I booked a private airport transfer and when we arrived we were on a large bus with multiple additional stops .
NEGATIVE	I called the driver 5 to 11 to inform him where he could find us , and then he told me that he was half an hour delayed .
NEGATIVE	I can ’ t trust them to collect us from our 200km journey to return us in time for our flight .
NEGATIVE	I consider making a formal complaint to the Croatia Tourism Board .
NEGATIVE	I contacted the company , NO reply at all .
NEGATIVE	I 'd advise customers to hire a car in order to avoid missing your flight home .
NEGATIVE	I definitely would not recommend this taxi service to anyone .
NEGATIVE	I did constaltly call the company but after 30 minutes the closed and did not answere the phone anymore .
NEGATIVE	I did not get these emails in time to reply so did not change the time and assumed someone would still be there at 10:45 , as confirmed the day before .
NEGATIVE	I do not know if the driver was tired or what was going on , whatever it is it was completely unacceptable .
NEGATIVE	I do not like to write negative reviews , especially when personally attacked , so have waited until now , so that my personal feelings of hurt would not color my review .
NEGATIVE	I do not recommend this at all .
NEGATIVE	I do not want an email at midnight telling me the time and location of my pickup the next day has been changed .
NEGATIVE	I don ’ t know if they really have the luxury cars or just trying to get extra money from people that choose the luxury cars .
NEGATIVE	I don ’ t mind going in standard cars but then I prefer standard prices and would find a lot better prices elsewhere .
NEGATIVE	I eventually had to book another transfer last minute which cost nearly twice as much ( €410 ) , the agent on the phone said they 'd cover this additional cost , and now have refused to do so .
NEGATIVE	I explained this but again not helpful and very rude in his manner .
NEGATIVE	I feel extremely cheated and would NEVER use CONNECTO again .
NEGATIVE	I felt like the guide is not enthusiastic about her job , just finishing the daily routine of guiding tour .
NEGATIVE	I gave 5 days notice and the company decides to charge 20 % for the cancellation for handling ( admin ) for the luxury car ( €347 ) .
NEGATIVE	I got caught up late on in day one of my first visit to Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	I got pushed twice by one of the staff members looking to push me along near the cable car itself .
NEGATIVE	I had email confirmation of the booking 3 weeks prior to the trip and re-confirmation , again by email , including pick up time and location and flight time and details , 36 hours in advance .
NEGATIVE	I had to spend 15min reading the instructions and making sure I fitted a seat properly I have never seen before .
NEGATIVE	I have called and emailed the Company repeatedly but no response : no acknowledgement , no denial of liability , no compensation - just a complete disregard for the customer and the stress , inconvenience and distress caused and extra expense incurred .
NEGATIVE	I have had two bad experiences with this company this year .
NEGATIVE	I have no trust in this company now , on top I had struggled to reach them by the phone .
NEGATIVE	I love good sightseeing spots but this cable car did not give that to me .
NEGATIVE	I m surprised by the rude and arrogant behaviour of the driver ... pathetic customer care service .
NEGATIVE	I made an official complaint to the Airport Manager and suggest anyone else who gets ripped off does the same .
NEGATIVE	I paid for a tour is to expect the guide will try his / her best to ensure everyone is good , the way they abandoned me in the middle of the way is really rude to me and irresponsible , the guide seemed like just want to off work earlier .
NEGATIVE	I raised the issue again and said I would post a review on tripadvisor , then I got a reply explaining the same thing again .
NEGATIVE	I raised the issue and got not reply .
NEGATIVE	I recommend going , just not with the cable cars !
NEGATIVE	I repeat they changed the tour and they do not go to budva .
NEGATIVE	I request all not to take their services .
NEGATIVE	I suspect we were the only ones on the tour and they cancelled it without the advance notice .
NEGATIVE	I think this company needs to offer a different price in winter if they are going to offer a totally different experience .
NEGATIVE	I told him we r waiting down he came in 15 min later , when we sat in front seat he said no u can not sit in front seat in 8 seater car we had to sit on last row seats, when we said if we need to use washroom on way will u stop as we had kid, he said no now non stop, u can not stop .
NEGATIVE	I told the woman that was incorrect and that I had the text message confirming it was 8am .
NEGATIVE	I travel in a wheelchair and I can not be improvising continuously .
NEGATIVE	I tried to show her my confirmation voucher which clearly wrote Montenegro Coast small group tour , but she simply didnt look at it and said " you are not in this tour " and drove striaght away .
NEGATIVE	I understand that it could be a problem with a car but you have to have some kind of back-up and you can not leave people in 35 ' C with small children waiting for a car which does not show up .
NEGATIVE	I understand that the tour company can not do anything about the wait at the border but there was just no communication at all .
NEGATIVE	I understand you need to consider the rest of the participants , but you need to know the importance of providing a good service .
NEGATIVE	I unfortunately gave them the benefit of the doubt and booked with them again in September .
NEGATIVE	I used it few times and often they was dirty , driver was slpooy and cars are old and no comfortable.
NEGATIVE	I used this company as I thought it had good reviews , little did I know what I was getting into .
NEGATIVE	I waited 20 minutes for the tour bus outside my hostel ( the location I had indicated at time of booking ) .
NEGATIVE	I waited over 40 minutes on the top for the return ride , and we did not receive any information how long we should wait .
NEGATIVE	I wanted to book a transfer from the Airport Innsbruck to Mayrhofen for my friend and me , in case of that we both was looking in the internet for a transfer for us my friend who was in the uk told me the price to mayrhofen it was showing to him more expensive than to me at the same time we was phon.
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed that we did not learn all that much during the tour .
NEGATIVE	I was horrified at their customer service .
NEGATIVE	I was not offered a reschedule or even my money back .
NEGATIVE	I was presented with two options : 1 ) take the new fare or 2 ) cancel the booking .
NEGATIVE	I was really disappointed that the agency scheduled the trip without consulting the weather forecast , but above all by the fact that they left the whole group under a thunder for more than three hours .
NEGATIVE	I was shocked with how long it took the get there as it only took 3 hours to get home .
NEGATIVE	I was still confused why it was higher and a day later received another email titled URGENT asking if I was happy to accept the new amount of 113 EURO .
NEGATIVE	I was told I could not go back up without paying the full fare .
NEGATIVE	I was told the driver was not coming and we were going to have to sort it out ourselves .
NEGATIVE	I were among the first 50 in the queue but after waiting for 1.5 hours I still found myself lining up waiting for the mini vans .
NEGATIVE	I will certainly not use this company again and will certainly not be recommending them to anyone else .
NEGATIVE	I will most certainly be telling friends and colleagues not to use it but rather get a bit of exercise and walk up Srd .
NEGATIVE	i will never enter that kind of cable car again .
NEGATIVE	I will never use this company again .
NEGATIVE	I will say no more .
NEGATIVE	I wonder why the company didn ’ t contact me to inform me that we had to wait a bit ?
NEGATIVE	I wonder why the company waited nearly 1 hour to inform me , and when they did , they told me that he was 15 minutes delayed , and not half an hour ?
NEGATIVE	I would be extremely cautious .
NEGATIVE	I would certainly not recommend this company .
NEGATIVE	I would definitely not be using this company again and would not recommend .
NEGATIVE	I would have cancelled if it was not for the fact that the transfer was about 12 hours away and there was no way of organising a different one .
NEGATIVE	I would never again book with Select Dubrovnik as they do not have the tourists ' best interest in mind .
NEGATIVE	I would never use them again , I never want to feel as helpless as that day and can not trust they will stick to their word regardless of when you book or how much you pay .
NEGATIVE	I would not do this over that 's for sure .
NEGATIVE	I would not trust this company as they are very unreliable and do not take the safety of their passengers seriously .
NEGATIVE	I would say skip the cable cars .
NEGATIVE	I DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE SIRS BECAUSE THE FEELING OF BEING IMPOSTORS WE WILL NEVER FORGET .
NEGATIVE	If he was there , he should have contacted the hotel staff about our whereabouts .
NEGATIVE	If I had not have phoned , 8 people would have been left at Corfu airport .
NEGATIVE	If that ’ s true it is very risky to go in their cars .
NEGATIVE	If they owe money , admit it and will not pay , then it is theft .
NEGATIVE	If this is how they treat potential new customers I can not believe there is still a business to run !
NEGATIVE	If we were to go back we definitely wouldn ’ t bother with this again .
NEGATIVE	If you are really desperate to go to the top ( where there is very little to see anyway apart from a good view , an exorbitant cafe and shop , and a museum about the war ) then do it, otherwise , ughhh give it a miss.
NEGATIVE	If you decide to visit Montenegro , it is quite beautiful , but I would think twice before taking this tour , this guide , or Magical Tours .
NEGATIVE	If you do not want to get ripped-off again though you will have to stand behind other tourists cramming to get pictures next to a gigantic cross .
NEGATIVE	If you have an adequate fitness level you can walk up and down to avoid the cost .
NEGATIVE	If you have mobility issues , especially a wheelchair , do not waste your money .
NEGATIVE	If you only have 2-3 hours for the inner city , do not risk loosing time with the cable car .
NEGATIVE	If you travel in high season there might be long queues at the bottom station of the cable car .
NEGATIVE	If you want to spend a tenner to travel for a few minutes up to an overpriced dusty dump on a hill then this is for you .
NEGATIVE	If not perhaps Conecto should not accept the booking or the money .
NEGATIVE	IF YOU APPRECIATE YOUR PEACE , DO NOT CONTACT THEM .
NEGATIVE	Important , please avoid my disheartening experience and possibly others , with the company Connect to Transfer , I booked a return trip on11th Dec 2017 from Hannover Airport to Bielefeld , on the 10th December KLM cancelled my return flight , immediately I called Croatia ( Connect to Transfer ) can...
NEGATIVE	In 2015 drivers seem to have been replaced by non-locals who can not speak the language but more interestingly,do not know the area and routes .
NEGATIVE	In Kator , we were teamed up with a lousy tour guide girl who did not mention anything more than we already knew from the bus and it left us with no tie to explore the city and walking up to the chapel on the hill - the bus guide misinformed us telling us we would have enough time .
NEGATIVE	In other places even if there were uncontrollable " technical problems " the operator would have sent buses to take their stranded customers down the hill but this operator showed no consideration whatsoever for the people they stranded .
NEGATIVE	In summary , please be aware that any legitimate changes you wish to make to your journey may lead to the loss of your deposit .
NEGATIVE	In the end I had to call a different company to rush us to the airport and pay again even though I had paid a deposit to Connecto .
NEGATIVE	in the end we decided to wait in a bar and we didn ’ t even see the waterfalls
NEGATIVE	In the winter departure time is not 16 : 00 PM , it is 15 : 30 !
NEGATIVE	In addition , I lost my passport in the post office in Mostar , what they did is to leave me in an unknown small town and ask you to do everything by yourself .
NEGATIVE	In addition she never bothered to let anyone know where restrooms were , or places for drinks / snacks / atm ’ s at rest stops .
NEGATIVE	In case you decide to ever go and try the Dubrovnik Cable Car be sure to check and over check the latest timetable so you do not end up like us walking for 1 hour in complete darkness on a small road full of stones and gravel .
NEGATIVE	In order to avoid booking those big coach tour which usually takes 2-3 hrs at Montenegro border control , I even sent a message to SelectDubrovnik to double confirm that I am booking the correct tour - the 18persons minibus tour .
NEGATIVE	Inside , it is dark due to heavy tinted windows and can be claustrophobic as the vehicle is filled to capacity .
NEGATIVE	Instead of aplogising , the compnay tried to use our card again .
NEGATIVE	It ’ s a mid evil city with a wall on the coast .
NEGATIVE	It did not look like he was trying to pass a car as we did not accelerate and we nearly went head on into an oncoming car .
NEGATIVE	It has been 30 working days since the incident and despite continuous e-mails , I have still not received the money and now they are not responding to my e-mails .
NEGATIVE	It is a danger break so that we could not use the buggy furthermore .
NEGATIVE	It is a row of four seats cramped next to each other , where only two seats are free for my friend and I. 
NEGATIVE	It is a tool simply to fleece the cruise ship passengers who spend a few hours in the city .
NEGATIVE	It is bad for Croatia to treat visitors like this .
NEGATIVE	It is badly run and expensive for what it is .
NEGATIVE	It is even inhumane , if it was happening in my city I would definitely find / direct an alternative , and pay the excess amount , and never let my customers down early morning , before dawn .
NEGATIVE	It is less than 3 minute ride and it is the most expensive cable car I have ever used
NEGATIVE	It is neither ethical nor responsible .
NEGATIVE	it is not my problem , find the path yourself , he is in charge of the cable car .
NEGATIVE	It is not a good ride as it is very short .
NEGATIVE	It is quite unprofessional and very bed experience .
NEGATIVE	It is the second time that this company leaves us stranded without our contracted service .
NEGATIVE	It lasted a few minutes and when it was over I wish I had not walked all the way up to the cable cars ( it 's quite a long walk ) .
NEGATIVE	It looked so different and I was expecting the cable car to take us all around the city however it really was a disappointment .
NEGATIVE	It looks like you can walk down a few hundred stairs and be back in Old Town , but that 's not the case .
NEGATIVE	It opens at 9 am , we got there 8.50 and there was already a long queue standing in the already baking sun .
NEGATIVE	It 's a LONG car ride and if you are prone to car sickness like I am , you might have a tough time on the windy roads .
NEGATIVE	It 's a very small ride and the cars are extremely crowded / suffocating .
NEGATIVE	It 's simply not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	It 's tight , people smell and you will not be able to see nothing anyways as they pack it to the brim .
NEGATIVE	It seems the groups off the cruise ships are given a priority .
NEGATIVE	It was a mistake !
NEGATIVE	It was also a 4 hour drive and was never offered to stop or any conversation for that matter .
NEGATIVE	It was an absolute harsh mistake , totally regretful about having done this .
NEGATIVE	It was late in the dark at nearly 7pm and 200 + people were stuck uphill in the dark lining in queue for hours to wait for some mini vans that could only take 6-7 persons each ride to take us down hill .
NEGATIVE	It was mediocre , service was below standards and we were left with 20 mins of running to the budva city and back ... did we take the tour to explore Montenegro or eat ?
NEGATIVE	It was not as expected and we were disappointed .
NEGATIVE	It was scary .
NEGATIVE	It was way too hot and boring to recommend anyone to see .
NEGATIVE	its a 2 minute ride that costs 30 euros for 2 people back and forth , offers nothing amazing view wise , and its a bad photo op since the cables are in the way all the time .
NEGATIVE	JUST stay away from SelectDubrovnik if u dont want your vacation ruined .
NEGATIVE	Lastly company instead of helping us to compensate for the amount we paid is also not willing to refund the initial amount which was being charged to us , which shows clear intention of cheating clients by taking money in advance and not giving them services
NEGATIVE	Later in budva , she ' recommended ' a restaurant that she said was fast and best of town - WRONG !
NEGATIVE	Let down is an understatement .
NEGATIVE	Lift in the upper building is not working or permanently occupied by staff so you are limited to the arrival level .
NEGATIVE	at just under £18 per person for a return trip lasting approx no more than 3 minutes each way it is nothing short of daylight robbery .
NEGATIVE	More of an opportunity to take a picture from the top of the walls and ocean but , you can do this as you are leaving Dubrovnik as well .
NEGATIVE	Most of the other tour guests were also suddenly told they would not be dropped off at the Pile Gate and were instead left at the cable car stop .
NEGATIVE	Much too pricey for two of us leta alone if you have children with you .
NEGATIVE	My advice is not to use them because it seems one could allege that there is a lack of integrity within their business .
NEGATIVE	My husband instantly blocked his card .
NEGATIVE	My parents took a view and said it not for them .
NEGATIVE	My review is based on next facts : - wife bought for whole family ( 4 pax ) as a surprise tour over the Viator for 182 $ ( around 160 EUR ) while later we found out that same package is sold on their website for 120 EUR - this is not old FORD car , this is cheap replica that every second of the tour.
NEGATIVE	My seatbelt was not working properly and this was the same for my husband and the lady sat next to me .
NEGATIVE	My wife was very upset and doubt whether we were discriminated as we are Asian .
NEGATIVE	name of driver was Michael, I would not reccommend this transfer agency .
NEGATIVE	Needed to get a taxi from city centre to Panarama Restaurant and as cable car not working we needed to get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	Needless to say , our day was canceled .
NEGATIVE	Needless to say due to the fact we were not given ANY prior notice our transfer was not turning up we missed our flight and had to wait 6 HOURS at the airport for the next flight .
NEGATIVE	Never again will choose Connecto because the do not connecto .
NEGATIVE	Never arrived .
NEGATIVE	No , I said , I have messages to prove it .
NEGATIVE	No driver at Geneva airport .
NEGATIVE	No family tickets .
NEGATIVE	No further contact was received from them .
NEGATIVE	No one said anything , climbed up hill past closed ticket office .
NEGATIVE	No thank you .
NEGATIVE	No thanks .
NEGATIVE	No tour guide .
NEGATIVE	No vehicle turned up .
NEGATIVE	No one said it was closed !
NEGATIVE	Nobody called back .
NEGATIVE	Nor were we told that we would not be stopping for lunch until 3pm !
NEGATIVE	Not much to see on top .
NEGATIVE	Not only would I suggest you do not ever use these companies but I will be taking the matter further to determine whether their behavior is fraudulent .
NEGATIVE	Not to mention , once we got onto this HUGE bus ( instead of luxury van ) , the bus was TOO large to even fit in the street of our villa so we had to WALK .
NEGATIVE	Not very customer friendly .
NEGATIVE	Not worth €20 return though for the cart .
NEGATIVE	Not worth it .
NEGATIVE	Not worth money as only on 3 minutes and the que was 45 mins long .
NEGATIVE	Not worth spending the money , in my view .
NEGATIVE	Not worth waiting for forty minutes while the operator takes her break and then calls you stupid for giving her the wrong paper .
NEGATIVE	Nothing much up there .
NEGATIVE	Nothing to see from the top but red brick roof top houses .
NEGATIVE	Nothing was said in the reviews about how hot mostar actually is .
NEGATIVE	On argument the driver threatened us to take us to police .
NEGATIVE	On leaving the restaurant a taxi was called for us , for this journey we were only charged 150 Kuna ’ s half of what we were charged by Dino - if you don ’ t want to be conned avoid this taxi driver at all cost .
NEGATIVE	On our visit we were told that the queue would only take 20 minutes , but people at the front told us they were waiting more than an hour .
NEGATIVE	On return journey the operator unexpectedly advised passengers they could not take the return journey and should either walk down or take a taxi .
NEGATIVE	A horror story .
NEGATIVE	On the first leg , the driver was 40 minutes late meeting us at Geneva Airport .
NEGATIVE	On the return leg , the driver did not show up at the agreed time .
NEGATIVE	On the return transfer the driver was not able to install the car seat and got it stuck half in .
NEGATIVE	On the way back , she was slow to answer any questions or concerns because she was too busy reclining on the front seat and reading her book .
NEGATIVE	On the way back they were over 2 hours late and did not provide a suitable car seat for my 3 year old son .
NEGATIVE	On the way home our Guide and Busdriver had a long , loud and annoying conversation .
NEGATIVE	On top there is a civil war museum that was small and not very interesting .
NEGATIVE	Once 30 minutes late and the other just never showed up .
NEGATIVE	the cable car is so crowded you can ’ t breath .
NEGATIVE	Once you ’ re up there , you can ’ t get good pictures as the cable car pylons rare in the way .
NEGATIVE	Once you are up there you will have nowhere to sit apart from at their own restaurant .
NEGATIVE	Once you go up its even a worse line to go down .
NEGATIVE	Only 2 cars and they were overcrowded .
NEGATIVE	Only if you are a photo freak you should spend so much to make a 3m up and down ride, the distance covered os too short and nothing special to offer !
NEGATIVE	Only on checking with our back we realised the full money was not refunded and only on then asking the company they started mentioning cancellation charges !
NEGATIVE	Operator was very rude and incosiderate to how the passengers would return back to the start point .
NEGATIVE	Our car was not as we booked - we had booked a luxury catagory and we got sent a tiny Renault .
NEGATIVE	Our driver did not provide any info during the trip at all .
NEGATIVE	Our driver was awful, and the driving was unacceptable .
NEGATIVE	Our driver was Russian , spoke NO English or French , not one word .
NEGATIVE	Our guide , Marinara , was not engaging with the group ( such as inviting questions or asking what our interests were ) .
NEGATIVE	Our of curiosity I went online to get another quote and was still quoted the original 92 EURO .
NEGATIVE	Our rental car company fitted our seat properly without me asking so I do not think it is unreasonable .
NEGATIVE	Over in a jiffy packed in like sardines .
NEGATIVE	Overall , I feel like I barely saw or learned anything today and was mostly just in a hurry to make the most of my limited time .
NEGATIVE	Overall , If you want to take a tour with a boring guide holding a history lesson , than this tour 100 % suit you .
NEGATIVE	Overall good reviews but my advice is if you need a taxi , hire a car instead .
NEGATIVE	Overall very stressful and inferior service - I certainly would NOT use them again and would NOT recommend !
NEGATIVE	Pathetic drivers and services .
NEGATIVE	Paying 570kuna ( 85Usd ) for a return trip is just not worth it .
NEGATIVE	Pick up 40 minutes late on both outward and return journeys .
NEGATIVE	Pick up from the apartment ( which had been booked at the same time as airport pick up ) was also late , again I had to cross the road and walk to the aforementioned bakery where the driver was sat on his phone .
NEGATIVE	Please avoid this company they are unreliable , unprofessional and more importantly dangerous .
NEGATIVE	Please do not do this trip if you are elderly , pregnant or have small children as the amount of time spent on the bus is ridiculous and whilst the falls and Mostar are nice ... you would be better hiring a car and doing this tour at your own pace .
NEGATIVE	Please DO NOT use this company .
NEGATIVE	Please think twice before booking with this company , Connecto Transfers .
NEGATIVE	Preordered minivan driver arrived 45 minutes late .
NEGATIVE	Pretty much a scam for me though , only a restaurant on top of the hill .
NEGATIVE	Put simply the cost of the cable car left a sour taste and spoilt the whole experience .
NEGATIVE	Queue jumping is basically encouraged and groups given priority over those who have been waiting for 15-30 mins .
NEGATIVE	Quite expensive , and although the view was good from the top it seems like a bit of a rip off .
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately he was 40 minutes late .
NEGATIVE	Really hiking prices to cash in on Game of Thrones and Cruise Ships
NEGATIVE	Really think carefully before booking these types of tours .
NEGATIVE	Refund promised , but what are the chances ?
NEGATIVE	Rip off
NEGATIVE	Ruined our day and stay in Split .
NEGATIVE	Save your moeny .
NEGATIVE	save your money and spend it on something else
NEGATIVE	Save yourself stress , time and ALOT of cash and book with someone else .
NEGATIVE	Secondly they are not transparent with their cancellation charges .
NEGATIVE	Seriously this is an overrated place .
NEGATIVE	Shame on you guys at connecto-taxi .
NEGATIVE	Shame you n you Conecto
NEGATIVE	She didn ’ t give anyone her phone number , and her instructions on where to meet or what we were doing were unclear at best .
NEGATIVE	She has not requested other people to change seats .
NEGATIVE	She is horrible, like a history teacher to repeat the information that you can find on the internet .
NEGATIVE	She just repeated " u wait for the next coach " and drove away ( again the " you are none of my business " attitude ) , leaving me and my wife on the road shocked and didnt know what to do .
NEGATIVE	She kept complaining about how much work she had to do to get us through the border .
NEGATIVE	She looked worried and panicked for most of the trip .
NEGATIVE	She rudely told us " you want to go with us or not , if not go and get the refund " , I chose to have my refund because the price and itinerary of the big coach n minibus tours are completely different , and I didnt want to compromise given their rude n careless attitude .
NEGATIVE	She says that , as we took a tour on the same bus the day before and we already knew we would be seated at the back , we should have said something earlier .
NEGATIVE	She says this would not be possible .
NEGATIVE	She then raised her voice and asked me to take my seat , noting that I am just one unhappy customer .
NEGATIVE	She was not pleasant .
NEGATIVE	She was probably getting commission for the guests , so she could not care less about what we saw and visited .
NEGATIVE	Simply appalling .
NEGATIVE	Simply because an incompetent cable car attendant decided it is more intelligent not to make a public announcement that this is the last trip going down .
NEGATIVE	Since then they have refused to return my deposit , although 17 hours notice was given , and no costs were incurred as a result , furthermore I forwarded KLM 's cancellation notification , but to no avail .
NEGATIVE	Skip this line skip this city .
NEGATIVE	Skip this place
NEGATIVE	SKIP the Cable Car & Rent a Car or hire a Taxi !
NEGATIVE	So , 5 stars for the view from the top , but I am afraid only 1 star for the greedy money making management .
NEGATIVE	So I asked her for the company address for refund and she wasnt even sure whether her company has offices in the old city !
NEGATIVE	So not a great experience and would obviously think twice about booking with this company again .
NEGATIVE	So we departed some 25min later than planned .
NEGATIVE	So we left - disappointed !
NEGATIVE	So we paid extremely high price for three taxi .
NEGATIVE	SO BEWARE   IF YOU BOOK ONLINE AND THEY CANCEL THE CABLE CARS YOU WILL NOT GET ANY KIND OF REFUND ONE VERY DISSATISFIED AND DISAPPOINTED COUPLE
NEGATIVE	Some nice views but not worth the cost .
NEGATIVE	the path is very dangerous and takes two hours .
NEGATIVE	Spend your money on other attractions
NEGATIVE	Stay away and use another company is my advice .
NEGATIVE	STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY unless all you want is a ride to the top of the mountain and back .
NEGATIVE	Still , no attempt to compensate , negotiate or discount from their ridiculous quote of 213 which was more than it would have cost to book 4 individual taxis !
NEGATIVE	Still nobody showed so we called the office twice once ourselves and once by our hotel .
NEGATIVE	Such an inefficient service !
NEGATIVE	Surely when a transfer is pre booked and the drop off address is given to the company the customer can expect to be dropped at least at a convenient place for the customer .
NEGATIVE	Terrible behaviour avoid this company .
NEGATIVE	it would be scary ! 
NEGATIVE	Thankfully the journey was only about 4 minutes but it was one of the most horrible , smelly , disgusting 4 minutes of my life .
NEGATIVE	That is really shameful , as we have to buy a new buggy .
NEGATIVE	That said , whilst we were in the City the organisation and communication from the people that run the cable car was astonishingly poor .
NEGATIVE	 i just can give 1 star !
NEGATIVE	The “ luxury minivan ” is a small vehicle that can accommodate up to 21 adults , including the driver and your guide .
NEGATIVE	The 2 ladies at bottom of the cable car ( where you purchase your tickets ) were extremely rude to us because it seems we could not read the sign that it was closed ) .
NEGATIVE	The activity cost a lot but was not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	The additional cost and delays to our vacation have been stressful .
NEGATIVE	The air conditioning on the mini bus only works when the bus is moving so this was a very long and warm wait .
NEGATIVE	The attitude of the cable car staff was " technical problem , not our problem " and made no attempt to assist those that were stranded .
NEGATIVE	The attraction is kind of overpriced , and you can drive up here for free .
NEGATIVE	The bus picked us up on time and the driving overall was uneventful , but the a / c had some sort of issue and I was either sweating profusely or freezing for the entire journey .
NEGATIVE	The cable and cars did not look stable enough to ride on .
NEGATIVE	The cable car costs $37.00 Canadian for a couple of minutes .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is a 150k round trip with long queues and incompetent staff .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is currently not working due to ' force majeure ' contract disagreements .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is like a sardine box , it 's totally not worth the money or the 30 min wait to go up .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is too packed to really make the most of the view up or down .
NEGATIVE	The cable care ride is very short , you need to wait in a long line to get in , it runs in 2 cars , each can take up to 30 people so inside the car you can be crowded actually by people .
NEGATIVE	The call centre is in Croatia and is staffed exclusively by extremely rude agents with poor English , who will argue with you and not bother apologising for messing up your holiday .
NEGATIVE	The company cancelled my Val D'isere to Geneva Airport transfer with < 2hrs notice , said they could pick me up an hour late which ( with Easter Monday ski resort traffic ) would likely make me miss my flight .
NEGATIVE	The company offered no solution or alternative .
NEGATIVE	The couple in front of us asked the sullen " gatekeeper " why hordes were allowed through when we had been queuing for an hour her answer was " they are a group " !
NEGATIVE	The drive from town to Dubrovnik airport was disaster .
NEGATIVE	The driver arrived after half an hour .
NEGATIVE	the driver basically would stop at various places and tell us " 15 minutes " - we were left to our own devices in trying to figure out what we were to look at .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show for this despite us paying the deposit .
NEGATIVE	The driver did not show up to collect us , despite having confirmation emails the day before , and we were left stranded .
NEGATIVE	The driver got to the hotel 1 hour late .
NEGATIVE	The driver kept saying it was the parent 's responsibility in croatia for the seat and then proceeded to try to fit the seat incorrectly before I stepped in .
NEGATIVE	The driver phoned the apartment for instructions and was told to take us to Pile gate but he decided not to because the traffic had been bad and he would be late for his next pick up .
NEGATIVE	The driver showed up 11:30 , and he told me that he had informed the company around 10 o'clock that he would be half an hour delayed , and that he asked them to inform me .
NEGATIVE	The driver spoke little English and never gave us any sort of narration .
NEGATIVE	The driver took us on a route driving quickly on a motor way and the safety of my child was put at risk .
NEGATIVE	the driver was also late in collecting us and we only made our ferry transfer by the skin of our teeth .
NEGATIVE	The driver was late for pickup , which ok , can happen but then 20 minutes late for our return to the airport - no contact made about any delay .
NEGATIVE	The Dubrovnik Cable car is a huge waste of money and better viewpoints can be seen renting a car ( which is also more cost effective if you are traveling a group ) .
NEGATIVE	The evening before the transfer ( which was early in the morning ) I get a call from their customer service saying they made a mistake when calculating the fare , and it is actually 160 EUR ( 50EUR more ) .
NEGATIVE	The first was in Berlin in 2017 and I withdrew my complaint and my complaint for the company 's apology and its offer to compensate for their incompetence .
NEGATIVE	The GORAN I SPOKE WITH SAYS HES DOESNT HAVE A MANAGER HE ’ S JUST CUSTOMER SERVICE apparently he can ’ t answer questions because his dispatcher is waving at him .
NEGATIVE	The guide from the minibus picked up two other tourists then wanted to leave immediately , without even looking at us .
NEGATIVE	The interior of the car was stinking after cold cigarette smoke and driver was chasing like there is no tomorrow .
POSITIVE	Had lunch in the panoramic restaurant service was great and lunch was lovely so relaxing !
POSITIVE	Half the joy is the journey getting to the cable car .
POSITIVE	Have a beer or glass of wine at the top and soak up the sunshine and beautiful views !
POSITIVE	Have a couple of coffee and dessert and enjoy the view slowly .
POSITIVE	Having bought a ticket we only had to wait approx 5 mins and in the height of tourist season is great .
POSITIVE	Having visited the walls last time and now the cable car , I would definitely recommend visiting the walls first then the cable car which gives a wider perspective and is even more stunning .
POSITIVE	Highly Recommend , but get there early !
POSITIVE	Homelands War exhibition just behind the top station was interesting and moving .
POSITIVE	However you do it , this is a must see !
POSITIVE	I ’ m happy the cable car ride was the first experience we did ( it was followed by a walking tour of the Old City and ended with a walk along the city walls ) .
POSITIVE	I am but the ride was smooth and quick !
POSITIVE	I am not great with heights but felt reassured and safe during the quick ride up to the top .
POSITIVE	I did not get the opportunity to do this the last time I visited Dubrovnik , so we had to do it this time around !
POSITIVE	I do not usually use cable cars but was glad I decided to travel on this one .
POSITIVE	I enjoyed the museum and cafe at the top aswell .
POSITIVE	I had the best risotto with scampi in a long time , and some great homemade icecream for a dessert .
POSITIVE	I have seen more expensive ones .
POSITIVE	I highly recommend going up , but do so right before sunset .
POSITIVE	I particularly enjoyed walking out on the hills beyond the war museum .
POSITIVE	I really loved it .

POSITIVE	I would also suggest visiting the restaurant at the top with the sea view .

POSITIVE	I would strongly encourage hiking to the top !
POSITIVE	If in Dubrovnik , do not miss it .
POSITIVE	If possible , come here before the sunset and you get a even more beautiful sunset view !
POSITIVE	If the weather is clear at the top , take this 4-minute cable car ride to the top for a stunning panoramic view .
POSITIVE	If you are feeling afluent the restaurant looked lovely .
POSITIVE	If you are in Dubrovnick , you must take the cable car - the view was simply amazing .
POSITIVE	If you book the cable car ride by itself , you can spend as much time on Mt.Srd as you like .
POSITIVE	If you can bring a bottle of wine and just enjoy the time .
POSITIVE	If you choose a clear day you will experience stunning views of the old town and surrounding area .
POSITIVE	If you do not have time for anything else , take the cable car and see the wonderful area that is Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	If you do one thing do this ride as the views from the top are amazing on a good day .
POSITIVE	If you go to OldTownDubrovnik , do not miss taking the cable car .
POSITIVE	If you have time , relax over drinks and lunch at the outdoor restaurant .
POSITIVE	If you have time , stop in to the Museum at the top , great views from its roof .
POSITIVE	If you have time take one way ticket it is cheaper and going down on foot ( ( takes about 30 min ) is very nice walk . 
POSITIVE	If you organised yourself I am sure you could enjoy several hours along the ridge - maybe even walk down .
POSITIVE	If you take photos , you have to go .
POSITIVE	If you want to have a fantastic , unobstructed view of Dubrovnik , old town and the surrounding areas , do not miss taking the cable up the hill behind the old town .
POSITIVE	Impressive view of the OldTown , the sea and certain parts of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	In case of Dubrovnik , this is the best thing to do ( of course you should visit the city wall ) .
POSITIVE	Incredible views of the whole of Dubrovnik , definitely worth the money for the return trip .

POSITIVE	It 's expensive but it 's well worth it .
POSITIVE	It 's newly reopened after being destroyed in the war and it 's well worth a visit .
POSITIVE	It 's not cheap to take the cable car ( about £15 ) but it is well worth it as the views from the top are fantastic - you can see not just the Old Town , but the whole Dubrovnik area , including the Babin Kuk area , Lapad , and all the little islands fading into the distance .
POSITIVE	It 's now a museum and worth checking out .
POSITIVE	It 's pricey but well worth the spend .

POSITIVE	To say it 's only 3.5 minutes long , you can see a great deal & it 's enough time to take in the stunning views of Dubrovnik & get some great snaps .
POSITIVE	To see the old town as well as the surrounding area is fantastic and worth the rids .
POSITIVE	To see the old town aswell as the surrounding area is fantastic and worth the rids  
POSITIVE	Took a trip to the top overlooking Dubrovnik and there is only one word to say , stunning !
POSITIVE	Took the car up later in the day , saw the most beautiful sunset ever !
POSITIVE	Took the time to have a drink in the outdoor restaurant which was pricey but worth it when you have such a view  .
POSITIVE	Tremendous photo opportunities .
POSITIVE	Tremendous views and opportunities for camera shops .
POSITIVE	Truely beautiful experience .
NEGATIVE	Or going by car in order to avoid waiting so long because of the huge amount of people .
NEGATIVE	I agree , it 's nice to see the city from the top .
NEGATIVE	But you can see it from many other spots , for free .
NEGATIVE	And the cable car is really expensive !
NEGATIVE	We came here during the " off-peak " seasons , still we spent more time queuing for the rides ( up and down ) than enjoying the view , which probably is not the best place anyway - a bit too far away from the town .
NEGATIVE	Up on the top was fully packed with tourist like us , and there is not a proper space to queue ... It 's not worth its price in my opinion .
NEGATIVE	We went up at sunset and it was truly beautiful . ( Although slightly lacking in atmosphere as there is little at the top other than a couple of sterile viewing platforms , a shop of tourist tat , and a snobby-looking restaurant ) .
NEGATIVE	The views from Mount Srd are really beautiful - I 'd recommend that any trip to Dubrovnik involve a trip up , along with a camera .
NEGATIVE	It was a pleasant two minute ascend but not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	My review is for the cable cars , rather than the mountain top .
NEGATIVE	Especially as there were then over 150 people waiting in the queue to go back down .
NEGATIVE	Arrived within 20 minutes and we were back in the Old Town in no time .
NEGATIVE	Go to the top : but walk it ( 90 minutes ) or get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	We booked an uber instead .
NEGATIVE	Beautiful views but was like being in an oven , no air conditioning so I did not really enjoy it .
NEGATIVE	At the top nice breeze with stunning views .
NEGATIVE	In some guide books it states that the 120 kuna for the cable car includes entry to the Museum at the top this is not the case you pay another 30 kuna which we did it was quite interesting with a lot of information about the War .
NEGATIVE	However , even with the reduce number of visitors , the cable cars are still very packed .
NEGATIVE	We had planned and visited Dubrovnik during the shoulder season .
NEGATIVE	And we obviously did not manage to get the windows view ( up and down the hill ) .
NEGATIVE	Cable car staff will try to squeeze in as many people as possible The compartment is rather big and only those near the windows can catch a glimpse of the view it was suppose to offer .
NEGATIVE	So you can try your luck with it .
NEGATIVE	After taking my initial photos of Old Town , I had to wait in line for the bathroom ( lines for both men 's and women 's room ) , wandered aimlessly around thinking there had to be more and then grabbed the next car back down .
NEGATIVE	My original plan was to take the cable car up and walk the path back down but I just ran out of time .
NEGATIVE	I was lucky to hit the ticket booth when there was a short line and was able to hop on the next car .
NEGATIVE	I had walked via stairs and small streets part way up the hill and got nicer pictures of Old Town than I did from the top .
NEGATIVE	Thank goodness I did not lose a lot of time getting the ticket or waiting for a car .
NEGATIVE	I would not repeat or recommend .
NEGATIVE	However if there is a big queue I 'd suggest just getting a taxi up .
NEGATIVE	The view at the top is great and I 'd recommend going up .
NEGATIVE	If we had not already purchased the tickets we 'd have definitely hopped in a taxi which would have been both cheaper and quicker .
NEGATIVE	Having said that apparently it 's not always this busy so if there is no queue it 's a quick way up .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is expensive and the journey up nothing special .
NEGATIVE	The day we were there we had queues of 30 minutes plus both ways .
NEGATIVE	We could not see many views on the way up as only the few people in front can see much of anything , but when we arrived at the top , the views were quite spectacular ; although not much different from the road just below that is taken to Dubrovnik when you come from Kotor , Montenegro .
NEGATIVE	But , we paid the money and decided it was probably worth it .
NEGATIVE	We were surprised to find that the cable car round trip ticket was 87 kn each , as this was much more than our guidebook said .
NEGATIVE	We went to the other platform as well , and we were not too impressed either .
NEGATIVE	But , the thing that really made our experience not so pleasant is that they began to have mechanical difficulties with the cable car and we had to wait about 90 minutes in line until they sent car after car empty back and forth to test that it was safe to take passengers again .
NEGATIVE	During this time of waiting , not a single staff person told us what was going on and when we finally got on the car to head back down , the staff person in the car merely shrugged his shoulders when we asked if the problem had been fixed .
NEGATIVE	So , we wished we had skipped this as it took us about 2.5 hours for the whole cable car experience , and we do not think it was worth the time .
NEGATIVE	And we did not think that the views from the top or the ride itself justified the amount of money they are charging .
NEGATIVE	The ride takes 2 minutes .
NEGATIVE	This is a great thing to do sadly overpriced .
NEGATIVE	Do it if you have to . but apart from the great views there is very little at the top
NEGATIVE	No clear directions to where to get on .
NEGATIVE	This was a disappointment .
NEGATIVE	Too many people crammed into the cable car so could not see the view and it was very warm .
NEGATIVE	Nothing at the top except the view and a very expensive restaurant which is fully booked !
NEGATIVE	Long wait in the sun for another crammed ride back down .
NEGATIVE	The view was ruined by the cables of the car .
NEGATIVE	Long walk to find the office .
NEGATIVE	The cable car itself is large , standing only and filled to the brim , this affords passengers with little chance to enjoy the view or experience going up and down .
NEGATIVE	The cue for the car is large but moves quite quickly , as you near the ticket kiosk the queue splits in two for those with tickets already purchased .
NEGATIVE	At the top , the views are stunning , however take a cab , bus or Uber and enjoy the views just the same .
NEGATIVE	Also a war museum and quad style safari 's on offer at the top .
NEGATIVE	A lovely looking outside terrace bar and inside panorama cafe at the top , long queues and we had not booked , would recommend booking if you want to experience either .
NEGATIVE	When they built this cable car they did not plan well for tourists .
NEGATIVE	The cables continuously get in the way of any picture you want to take of the old town of Dubrovnik and it could have been perfect for a beautiful sunset picture but they do not have any viewpoints for sunset .
NEGATIVE	It appears that they are best set up for sunrise as they have a grandstand set up to the east , however i am not sure what time it opens however it might mean you beat the tremendous crowds .
NEGATIVE	Instead you have to hike up out the back a fair way well off the beaten track .
NEGATIVE	It will offer spectacukar views unless it 's rainy and cloudy or foggy lime Fahrenheit we went .
NEGATIVE	In which case it was an hour of my life I can not get back ,
NEGATIVE	Time it so you are walking back down at sunset for amazing panoramic views
NEGATIVE	The cable car is expensive , crammed and ultimately unnecessary .
NEGATIVE	We decided to go up in the cable car and walk back down , but the walk is so nice - and relatively easy - that we wish we 'd walked both ways .
NEGATIVE	Really expensive .
NEGATIVE	Handy for those who can not do the walk but money is a lot .
NEGATIVE	Views are far more spectacular .
NEGATIVE	Climb the mountain by foot if possible .
NEGATIVE	The cafe / restaurant at the top is way overpriced and if you are just getting a drink they make you sit in the back corner .
NEGATIVE	You are not even high enough to see over the cables and the cables run right over the old town below so you can not even get a good picture .
NEGATIVE	If you walk around the cable car building and follow the road , there is a field .
NEGATIVE	The view is not even that great .
NEGATIVE	It is a RIP OFF .
NEGATIVE	It was a great place to watch the sunset .
NEGATIVE	The only thing worth anything at the top of that mountain !
NEGATIVE	You can see better views from road above city coming from kotor .
NEGATIVE	Views obstructed by cables ,
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed .
NEGATIVE	You go up , look around for a few minutes and then come down , not exactly thrilling or worth the money .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride is not more than 2 mins long and It felt like we were in a heard of cattle , as it often does in places over-run with tourists .
NEGATIVE	The view was lovely but once you ’ re at the top there isn ’ t much to do unless you want to sit down for an overpriced lunch .
NEGATIVE	Not worth the $60 round trip for two people .
NEGATIVE	140 kunas or about £18 to get to ride in a cramped space with 30 other people to get to the top of a hill pretty much sums it up .
NEGATIVE	The view at the top is cool we went at around 6 at night it was not too busy and the town was lit up and sun was setting but we avoided the two restaurants at the top that just scream tourist trap .
NEGATIVE	We spent about 15 mins looking at the view and then left ... so again , not worth the money !
NEGATIVE	Long queues to buy tickets .
NEGATIVE	It is bit expensive also .
NEGATIVE	Have seen better views .
NEGATIVE	Cable Car was not too exciting .
NEGATIVE	Should have some sort of ticketing in force as when I was there it was 37 degrees and you just could not stand for that long in the heat people , were melting ! !
NEGATIVE	Did not even manage to get on cable cAr as the queues were just mad ! !
NEGATIVE	We took a ride down with this cable car and we were very disappointed .
NEGATIVE	Considering that the price is about 10 euros we were expecting more than it Just being a transportation means .
NEGATIVE	The trip took a minute or less and it was so crowded that we could not see anything from where we stood .
NEGATIVE	Will not ride again .
NEGATIVE	There are huge queues & when you get to the top the view is great but that 's it & then huge queue to get bank down again .
NEGATIVE	Save your money .
NEGATIVE	There are poor stray dogs at the top that no one seems to want to help or even comment on if you ask about them .
NEGATIVE	It was around 50 gbp for 2 of us the ride took 4 mins each way !
NEGATIVE	Very disappointed . .
NEGATIVE	Poor value and hard to find and not worth the effort !
NEGATIVE	By the time you get to the lower station you might as well continue the walk up .
NEGATIVE	It is a very short ride and quite expensive . 150 kn .
NEGATIVE	Windy and chilly the day in March that I went but they have blankets to keep you cosy while you enjoy .
NEGATIVE	Lovely spot to sit and view the old city .
NEGATIVE	It 's better to do sunset panoramic tours which takes you to many beautiful spots on Srd .
NEGATIVE	Very long queues at the entrance during sunset tine .
NEGATIVE	It 's super expensive for a gondola ride .
NEGATIVE	I give this a two because of the poor service we received at the top .
NEGATIVE	Along with a bunch of other people , we waited in line for 30-45 minutes .
NEGATIVE	However , it started to look stormy and we decided that we should probably take the cable car down the mountain .
NEGATIVE	We had some time to enjoy the sunset ( in July it was about 8:15 p.m. ) .
NEGATIVE	We decided to hike the trail up and be at the top for sunset .
NEGATIVE	We enjoyed the hike with the 16 switchbacks .
NEGATIVE	They would not sell us tickets and would not allow us to get on and buy tickets at the bottom .
NEGATIVE	We walked out , not too happy , and found a number of people sheltering in some buggies still waiting for taxies after 30 minutes .
NEGATIVE	When we reached the top , they had just closed down the ticket office ( even though there were still lots of people to go down and it was not closing time yet ) .
NEGATIVE	After some discussion , they gave us a number to call for a taxi .
NEGATIVE	By 9:45 p.m. , the rain had stopped , and we decided to walk down the trail .
NEGATIVE	We discovered that the museum was still open until 10 pm , so we paid the entry fee there and learned about the 1991 attacks on Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	It was sobering and educational and I would recommend the museum .
NEGATIVE	Fortunately , we had brought flashlights with us .
NEGATIVE	If you booked in advance it might be nice to eat at the restaurant , if you could secure a table with a view , as the prices were the same as in the town .
NEGATIVE	It is hard to take pictures , because of the cable car lines and machinery being strung across your view .
NEGATIVE	The space at the top is small with most of it being taken up by a restaurant .
NEGATIVE	The views from the wall are far better .
NEGATIVE	Alas , you must pay to enter the war exhibit ( which is hidden around the corner and up the dirt path ) - only 30kuna per person but as it was on top of the cable car ride , it made it expensive .
NEGATIVE	It was expensive but we thought a nice cold drink at the top with beautiful views together with a nose around the war exhibit would make it worthwhile .
NEGATIVE	We bought return tickets on a very hot day .
NEGATIVE	Especially since the exhibit seemed a little basic .
NEGATIVE	Old city prices , but you do not have to pay to enter the old city !
NEGATIVE	The souvenir shop did not sell cold bottled drinks as you might hope , and so down we came again .
NEGATIVE	What 's more , the bar at the top of the cable car was extortionate - 57kuna for a bottled beer .
NEGATIVE	Us Yorkshire folk do not like being ripped off .
NEGATIVE	If you are driving , there is a big car park ( rough land ) behind the top of the cable car station .
NEGATIVE	Why not avoid extortionate old town parking costs ( up to 50kuna per hour ) drive up the hill to the top of the cable car , take the car down , explore the old city and then take the cable car back up ?
NEGATIVE	Visit the bakery opposite the cable car ticket office to buy cold drinks and snacks to take up with you 2 .
NEGATIVE	My top tips if you want to go up : 1 .
NEGATIVE	I wish we had ! ! !
NEGATIVE	I would not class this as a must do .
NEGATIVE	If you like aerial views - ok - but I think its a lot of money and £10 for a small beer and a bitter lemon at a stand-up bar was not welcome
NEGATIVE	We tried to get on twice for sunset ( 7.15pm ) and started queueing at 6pm .
NEGATIVE	Couldn ’ t get on either time as was nowhere near the front .
NEGATIVE	Drove instead .
NEGATIVE	Nb .
NEGATIVE	Hairpin bends .
NEGATIVE	Be a confident driver in these conditions or get a cab ! !
NEGATIVE	Single track rubble road .
NEGATIVE	Dinner at the top was alright .
NEGATIVE	Prebook if you don ’ t want to wait .
NEGATIVE	Good views of the town can be got from walking the walls
NEGATIVE	Very expensive with nothing to do once at the top .
NEGATIVE	It ’ s the cruise ships that taint the Dubrovnik experience .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is modern , easy to find and fast though it is very expensive ... It could be fantastic but the panoramic view has a nice view on - the restaurant - the cables of the cable car Means we can not see the old town from there without the cables and we can not see the magic sunset on the El...
NEGATIVE	This is definitelly a bad design and we would not recommend it until they build a proper terrace embrassing the magic view ! !
NEGATIVE	Times that by say 5 ships , then the daily invasion on the 45,000 local populous and families are immense .
NEGATIVE	You have to remember that all these people aren ’ t paying for accommodation locally , or breakfast or indeed dinner .
NEGATIVE	An average cruise ship could hold as many as 5,000 day trippers .
NEGATIVE	We went as a family of 4 .
NEGATIVE	The only way for the local businesses to prosper or pay for the facilities neeed to cope is to charge for it via the attractions that the daily cruise enthusiasts visit .
NEGATIVE	Our 15 year old was charged at an adult price so the 5 minute cable car ride up to the mount of Srd cost us around £100 Sterling or 700kr return .
NEGATIVE	Thus they are busy and expensive .
NEGATIVE	The city walls and the cable car .
NEGATIVE	On a whole there are two they swarm too .
NEGATIVE	The taxi driver points out the local history and what you are looking at AND they stop on the way up where the best place is to take advantage of a good photo is . ( It ’ s not st the top as you might think ) In the cable car it ’ s crowded and only the first 4 in get in a position to see the view ....
NEGATIVE	At the top your panoramic photos are spoiled by the cable car posts and wires .
NEGATIVE	Compare that to a taxi , which is about 50Kr return or £8.50 , then you can see the difference for yourself .
NEGATIVE	Remember it ’ s the same view at the top .
NEGATIVE	Top tip - save yourself some time queuing , a lot of money and a disappointment and get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	Every review you wil read here will talk about the view NOBODY describes the the journey , so no need to break the bank to get there .
NEGATIVE	The professional promotional photos of Dubrovnik are actually taken half way down the hill .
NEGATIVE	The view was great but there is nothing to do when you are up there so we just waited for the next cable car to take us back down .
NEGATIVE	I am terrified of heights so was practically forced in to this trip !
NEGATIVE	Would not bother going up there again .
NEGATIVE	Probably to do if never took a cable car in your life , or if you want to share a small room with a lot of rude chinese or korean tourist
NEGATIVE	The view from the cable car is quite good .
NEGATIVE	There nothing else once you get up to the top .
NEGATIVE	But then I 'd say that 's about it .
NEGATIVE	There is a amphitheatre but when we visited it was not really active
NEGATIVE	Just a restaurant with limited vegetarian options and a souvenir store .
POSITIVE	Amazing views of the old city & out over the sea from the top .
POSITIVE	Price for return on cable Car was 120 kuna each ?
POSITIVE	This gave a fascinating history of the defence of Dubrovnik by a small group of locals in the 1990s .
POSITIVE	We visited the Napolionic fort at the top of the hill overlooking the old town of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Just around the corner from the museum is the cable car .
POSITIVE	It also gave us the best view of the old town too .
POSITIVE	We found that it would cost 170 kuna each , which included entrance into the museum but we worked out that an Uber up , entrance to the museum and a cable car ride down worked out cheaper . 30K Uber . 4 x museum tickets 120K , 4 x tickets on the cable car 120K .
POSITIVE	The cable car at 94Kuna each is not cheap but the views , as many have said , are fantastic .
POSITIVE	Try to go up either late or early in the day before the cruise ships & tour buses go .
POSITIVE	The cable car , at the top , has a restaurant but I believe it is expensive .
POSITIVE	We spent around 1.5 hours just admiring the wonderful view .
POSITIVE	We went up at 4:30 pm , & it was not that crowded as the tour groups had already left .
POSITIVE	We only went from top to bottom .
POSITIVE	The views were fantastic .
POSITIVE	The pound as I write this = 8K .
POSITIVE	It was short journey but definitely view is great . ( panoramic ) .
POSITIVE	The ride each way only takes a few minutes but unless you can hike up very steep mountains , take the cable car .
POSITIVE	The food in the restaurant was also very good so this was an ideal trip to while away a few of hours .
POSITIVE	The ride down is smooth and a_lot easier than walking down which you can do along a very zig zaggy path .
POSITIVE	Some of my friends said that its expensive but all i can say is the view is amazing .
POSITIVE	Weather was nice and so surprisingly there was not a_lot_of people .
POSITIVE	The vista includes the Island_of_Lokrum , the Old_Town_of_Dubrovnik , Lapad_&_Babin_Kuk , Gruz_Harbour and all the way over the Elfati_Islands .
POSITIVE	The cable car is worth every penny for the amazing views from the top of Mount_Srd .
POSITIVE	The views from there are fantastic though and free .
POSITIVE	Stunning !
POSITIVE	Such a great view from the top of this cable car ride it has to be done if you are in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Smooth ride and easy to use .
POSITIVE	Gift shop and restaurant at the top as_well .
POSITIVE	A must do as the most amazing views .
POSITIVE	Stunning !
POSITIVE	A few tips , check out the arrival of cruise ships before you go there are several sites that will tell you this information and if it busy always go later in the afternoon when it ’ s quieter , buy the war museum entry ticket with your cable car ticket , lovely restaurant nice food at the top think...
POSITIVE	Such a good vantage point for photos , and very good Homeland_War exhibition at the fort .
POSITIVE	Highly recommended
POSITIVE	Visit the Srdj - where the Croatians held out against the Serbian onslaught and kept Dubrovnik free of occupation .
POSITIVE	If there is a queue and you haven ’ t bought your ticket go to the right hand side of the queue as the ticket office is there and rejoin the queue .
POSITIVE	See the old city , the outer city , the many islands and a beautiful Adriatic sea .
POSITIVE	Not a scary cable car ride if you are not keen on heights .
POSITIVE	Outstanding views and a_lot_of history shown .
POSITIVE	Although I was told there was room , I said the car was too crowded and was allowed to wait for the next one .
POSITIVE	Make sure you do not get into a crowded car as there is little scope to move around it if it is packed .
POSITIVE	You get a great panoramic view from the top of the mountain after enjoying the ride up .
POSITIVE	Many people were walking both up and down , but down definitely seemed the way to go to me .
POSITIVE	You will overlook entire Dubrovnic and the Adriatic sea to the horizon .
POSITIVE	If the weather is clear , take a trip .
POSITIVE	Well worth a trip up .
POSITIVE	A_bit expencive , but wort while .
POSITIVE	A must if you like wonderful views .
POSITIVE	We went up on a clear day about 1pm the views of the old city are spectacular also the panoramic views are amazing .
POSITIVE	Both me and my husband are nervous of heights so the short ride was just enough for us .
POSITIVE	Wow .... really loved this ride .
POSITIVE	A_lot_of people waiting in line , but well worth the wait !
POSITIVE	Once at the top , walk all around to fully appreciate the views .
POSITIVE	We went at lunch time so this could be avoided .
POSITIVE	If you have time , relax over drinks and lunch at the outdoor restaurant .
POSITIVE	Our cruise ship came into Dubrovnik , and after walking around this beautiful city , we decided to take the cable car ride up for the breathing panoramic views .
POSITIVE	There is a small museum giving an account of the history of the cable car and a missable gift shop .
POSITIVE	When we got to to top we had lunch over looking all those beautiful views in the open restaurant .
POSITIVE	Prices reasonable and service brilliant even_though they were very busy .
POSITIVE	A small queue to be seated but well worth it .
POSITIVE	The views were stunning .
POSITIVE	To get to the height that it takes you and to see the old town and the view of Lokrum_Island is unreal .
POSITIVE	The view is so impressive just as it is !
POSITIVE	There is a hugh cross just to the left of the restaurant which makes for another beautiful photo .
POSITIVE	WiFi is available and we saw several people emailing their photos from their cellphones .
POSITIVE	Everywhere you look , is a beautiful photographic vista .
POSITIVE	A real must if visiting Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	We did not bring our binoculars , but we were not disappointed .
POSITIVE	Let this be part of your Dubrovnik bucket list .
POSITIVE	Going for sunset provides a hell of a view .
POSITIVE	The view is beautiful , and it 's great to see the city from above .
POSITIVE	I think the cable car is worth doing .
POSITIVE	When I went there was no line , and the cars went up and down frequently .
POSITIVE	It is a_bit difficult to find the station in hilly Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The views are great and the machine is safely built in Germany .
POSITIVE	No need to queue if you take the cable car later in the day when the cruise passengers are gone .
POSITIVE	I did not eat at the restaurant , just went up , walked around at the top for a_bit , and went back down .
POSITIVE	You can get the tickets in several places in town .
POSITIVE	This is one of the must things to do in Dubrovnik !
POSITIVE	About an hour was enough .
POSITIVE	You get an entirely new perspective to the red rooftops of the city from up here !
POSITIVE	It is less than four minutes but provides the best views anywhere .
POSITIVE	Not much else than stunning views at the top ( if you are not into war museums ) , so you can probably take the next car down .
POSITIVE	We went in the morning and I am sure it would be much busier later_on in the day .
POSITIVE	Most pleasant maybe to plan lunch up there in one of the cafes
POSITIVE	Lovely views from the top , well worth the visit .
POSITIVE	Cars are not jam packed , plenty_of room to move while travelling up and down .
POSITIVE	Pricey if you want a drink so take a bottle of water with you . £3 to go round the castle / museum worth it .
POSITIVE	Certainly worth the £20 ticket the views once you get to the top are fantastic .
POSITIVE	You find out a_lot about the Croats fight for independence .
POSITIVE	Relatively new cable car effortlessly gets you to the top of Srd hill for a fantastic view of Dubrovnik_Old_Town .
POSITIVE	Good to do around dusk to have the chance of seeing a gorgeous sunset .
POSITIVE	Camera is a must .
POSITIVE	When up there stay until sunset to catch some beautiful night pictures of Dubrovnik by night !
POSITIVE	Stunning view , try to go at the end of the day to enjoy the sunset on the awesome terrasse .
POSITIVE	You should buy your ticket before from the net to avoid the queue .
POSITIVE	When in Dobrovnik you must take the gondola and go up the hill ! ! !
POSITIVE	Excellent site to visit and enjoy the view of this superb city by the sea .
POSITIVE	Definately worth a visit specially in the summer to escape the tourist hustle and bustle around the old town .
POSITIVE	You can go for a walk at the top or to the restaurant over looking Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	It was such fun going up the cable car and the views were amazing .
POSITIVE	Spectacular view and ride .
POSITIVE	We loved it .
POSITIVE	Really nice restaurant and fabulous views make this a must .
POSITIVE	The story of the fort on Mt._Srd is very poignant .
POSITIVE	Worth a visit especially on a hot day as it is slightly cooler at the top .
POSITIVE	A great trip in the cable car which gave you excellent views of the city , good restaurant and the museum was excellent .
POSITIVE	Stunning views .
POSITIVE	A quick and steep cable car journey takes you high above the city .
POSITIVE	The views across the Adriatic and city are stunning .
POSITIVE	I took the cable car up for sunset and was not disappointed .
POSITIVE	Queues not too long .
POSITIVE	A must do trip if visiting Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	There is a resteraunt and bar at the top .
POSITIVE	Please be aware at peak season this is the busiest time to use the cable car so you may have to wait .
POSITIVE	You can travel round trip for 120kn .
POSITIVE	The views are amazing .
POSITIVE	Good way to see all of the walled city from above .
POSITIVE	If you are visiting Dubrovnik you must try the cable car view from top is amazing there are cafes there you can sit for sometime and take photos
POSITIVE	The best bit aside from the view ( marred a little by the cable car pillars ) , is the cafe bar , where you will be served reasonably priced delicious cocktails , by lovely waiters .
POSITIVE	the cable car is just outside the city walls and is worth going up to get the pictures of the old town . we went up about 10 am and it was busy , we noticed it was busy up to 12 oclock then eased off
POSITIVE	There are various viewing spots at the top and a restaurant .
POSITIVE	I waited 15 mins to come down .
POSITIVE	It was not to bad !
POSITIVE	Another must do .
POSITIVE	The sightseeing from the city is wonderful ! !
POSITIVE	A quick ride up to the top but what a view .
POSITIVE	When it gets a little cold , it 's great to snuggle under the red blankets and the patio heaters !
POSITIVE	It was too hot to walk the walls so this was a better option .
POSITIVE	Such an awesome experience ! !
POSITIVE	The cable car up Mount_Srd is a must-do for anyone in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	There are line-ups so plan your time .
POSITIVE	Bliss .
POSITIVE	It is a smooth cable car ride because this is not a place of particularly strong winds .
POSITIVE	In April there were lower temperatures than we wanted and a_bit of a breeze so the Panorama_Restaurant provided a blanket and a heater that buffered the temp and the breeze .
POSITIVE	Words can not explain how awesome the view is !
POSITIVE	Make sure you save enough time for the superior restaurant and lots of photos .
POSITIVE	Really worth it
POSITIVE	It probably would not be worth doing without ok weather as the whole point is being able to look down and take in the Old_Town in the surrounding context .
POSITIVE	Well dressed , courteous staff offered a splendid menu but we had not allotted time so just enjoyed the view and the Croatian beer .
POSITIVE	Totally recommend to go for the sunset ... Try to be one of the first ones to go inside the cabin and pic the front corner ... there is the better view .
POSITIVE	The cable car itself is really not all that special but the views from the top are .
POSITIVE	The cable car gives a couple of minutes ride up the hill overlooking Dubrovnik and the Adriatic_Sea .
POSITIVE	They are nice starting points but they do not offer much that the surrounding Mount_Srd area dosesn't offer .
POSITIVE	The views the other way - towards Bosnia - are not especially attractive across a surprisingly barren environment without much fauna at all .
POSITIVE	We SHOULD have gone to the Fort that defended Dubrovnik but ALL the things we missed will lead us back to this lovely adventure spot .
POSITIVE	We could also have gone on the dune buggy rides but did not .
POSITIVE	There are two observation decks at the higher station .
POSITIVE	There are two other features at the top of Srd - a huge cross that serves as a memorial and a Napoleonic fort that saw serious action in the " Homeland War " .
POSITIVE	The approach to the fort is amusing with a little danger sign extolling the risks of heading that way but the fort itself is very moving even_if the Napoleonic and Habsburg history has been glossed over somewhat and what remains of the ruined fortress contains a museum celebrating the defence of Dub...
POSITIVE	The outside restaurant has amazing views - worth going there for eating / drinking in such an amazing location rather than for the quality of the food .
POSITIVE	If a traveller had a choice between walls or cable car , they should forget the walls because the much better view is from the top .
POSITIVE	The trip in the cable car is quite relaxing and a great experience - go for it !
POSITIVE	The views are fantastic and the food and service is great .
POSITIVE	Visit the Museum and take in lunch or dinner .
POSITIVE	there r always someone in charge inside the cable car , that makes you feel more comfortable and safe : ) even someone like me who feels dizzy in higher altitudes : ) but everything worths to see the view !
POSITIVE	This city was shelled for more than five months in the 90s and a view from the top of the mountain gives some idea of what the people suffered .
POSITIVE	A spectacular way to really get an idea of the old city and it 's huge , thick walls .
POSITIVE	Be prepared to queue and wait for quite a while to be able to access the mountain top .
POSITIVE	I like this cable car because you have very beautiful view during your trip to the Srd mountain and it is not expensive at all
POSITIVE	This part of the country highlights its role in the siege of 1991-2 whilst the rest of Croatia seems not to want to acknowledge that it occured .
POSITIVE	The trip up to the top of Mt_Srd takes about 3 minutes and the views are stunning on the way up .
POSITIVE	Once at the top you can explore the trails and look down on the city from 400metres above .

POSITIVE	My wife and I went up in the cable car twice on our trip to Dubrovnik , we went up in the evening as the sun was setting and enjoyed a fantastic meal in the restaurant with the best views ( reserve a table on the edge to get the best views as the restaurant gets very busy ) we then decided to return...
POSITIVE	Getting to the Cable_Car_Station is a_bit of a climb , but if you do not like steps it is on a main road so with a map you could avoid those steps .
POSITIVE	Found the Cable_Car on the very first afternoon , when the sun was shining .
POSITIVE	Flight time is only about 3 minutes , and not even worth taking photos as you go , wait till the top where you will be very rewarded .
