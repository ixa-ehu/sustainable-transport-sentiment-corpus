NEGATIVE	Or going by car in order to avoid waiting so long because of the huge amount of people .
NEGATIVE	I agree , it 's nice to see the city from the top .
NEGATIVE	But you can see it from many other spots , for free .
NEGATIVE	And the cable car is really expensive !
NEGATIVE	We came here during the " off-peak " seasons , still we spent more time queuing for the rides ( up and down ) than enjoying the view , which probably is not the best place anyway - a bit too far away from the town .
NEGATIVE	Up on the top was fully packed with tourist like us , and there is not a proper space to queue ... It 's not worth its price in my opinion .
NEGATIVE	We went up at sunset and it was truly beautiful . ( Although slightly lacking in atmosphere as there is little at the top other than a couple of sterile viewing platforms , a shop of tourist tat , and a snobby-looking restaurant ) .
NEGATIVE	The views from Mount Srd are really beautiful - I 'd recommend that any trip to Dubrovnik involve a trip up , along with a camera .
NEGATIVE	It was a pleasant two minute ascend but not worth the price .
NEGATIVE	My review is for the cable cars , rather than the mountain top .
NEGATIVE	Especially as there were then over 150 people waiting in the queue to go back down .
NEGATIVE	Arrived within 20 minutes and we were back in the Old Town in no time .
NEGATIVE	Go to the top : but walk it ( 90 minutes ) or get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	We booked an uber instead .
NEGATIVE	Beautiful views but was like being in an oven , no air conditioning so I did not really enjoy it .
NEGATIVE	At the top nice breeze with stunning views .
NEGATIVE	In some guide books it states that the 120 kuna for the cable car includes entry to the Museum at the top this is not the case you pay another 30 kuna which we did it was quite interesting with a lot of information about the War .
NEGATIVE	However , even with the reduce number of visitors , the cable cars are still very packed .
NEGATIVE	We had planned and visited Dubrovnik during the shoulder season .
NEGATIVE	And we obviously did not manage to get the windows view ( up and down the hill ) .
NEGATIVE	Cable car staff will try to squeeze in as many people as possible The compartment is rather big and only those near the windows can catch a glimpse of the view it was suppose to offer .
NEGATIVE	So you can try your luck with it .
NEGATIVE	After taking my initial photos of Old Town , I had to wait in line for the bathroom ( lines for both men 's and women 's room ) , wandered aimlessly around thinking there had to be more and then grabbed the next car back down .
NEGATIVE	My original plan was to take the cable car up and walk the path back down but I just ran out of time .
NEGATIVE	I was lucky to hit the ticket booth when there was a short line and was able to hop on the next car .
NEGATIVE	I had walked via stairs and small streets part way up the hill and got nicer pictures of Old Town than I did from the top .
NEGATIVE	Thank goodness I did not lose a lot of time getting the ticket or waiting for a car .
NEGATIVE	I would not repeat or recommend .
NEGATIVE	However if there is a big queue I 'd suggest just getting a taxi up .
NEGATIVE	The view at the top is great and I 'd recommend going up .
NEGATIVE	If we had not already purchased the tickets we 'd have definitely hopped in a taxi which would have been both cheaper and quicker .
NEGATIVE	Having said that apparently it 's not always this busy so if there is no queue it 's a quick way up .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is expensive and the journey up nothing special .
NEGATIVE	The day we were there we had queues of 30 minutes plus both ways .
NEGATIVE	We could not see many views on the way up as only the few people in front can see much of anything , but when we arrived at the top , the views were quite spectacular ; although not much different from the road just below that is taken to Dubrovnik when you come from Kotor , Montenegro .
NEGATIVE	But , we paid the money and decided it was probably worth it .
NEGATIVE	We were surprised to find that the cable car round trip ticket was 87 kn each , as this was much more than our guidebook said .
NEGATIVE	We went to the other platform as well , and we were not too impressed either .
NEGATIVE	But , the thing that really made our experience not so pleasant is that they began to have mechanical difficulties with the cable car and we had to wait about 90 minutes in line until they sent car after car empty back and forth to test that it was safe to take passengers again .
NEGATIVE	During this time of waiting , not a single staff person told us what was going on and when we finally got on the car to head back down , the staff person in the car merely shrugged his shoulders when we asked if the problem had been fixed .
NEGATIVE	So , we wished we had skipped this as it took us about 2.5 hours for the whole cable car experience , and we do not think it was worth the time .
NEGATIVE	And we did not think that the views from the top or the ride itself justified the amount of money they are charging .
NEGATIVE	The ride takes 2 minutes .
NEGATIVE	This is a great thing to do sadly overpriced .
NEGATIVE	Do it if you have to . but apart from the great views there is very little at the top
NEGATIVE	No clear directions to where to get on .
NEGATIVE	This was a disappointment .
NEGATIVE	Too many people crammed into the cable car so could not see the view and it was very warm .
NEGATIVE	Nothing at the top except the view and a very expensive restaurant which is fully booked !
NEGATIVE	Long wait in the sun for another crammed ride back down .
NEGATIVE	The view was ruined by the cables of the car .
NEGATIVE	Long walk to find the office .
NEGATIVE	The cable car itself is large , standing only and filled to the brim , this affords passengers with little chance to enjoy the view or experience going up and down .
NEGATIVE	The cue for the car is large but moves quite quickly , as you near the ticket kiosk the queue splits in two for those with tickets already purchased .
NEGATIVE	At the top , the views are stunning , however take a cab , bus or Uber and enjoy the views just the same .
NEGATIVE	Also a war museum and quad style safari 's on offer at the top .
NEGATIVE	A lovely looking outside terrace bar and inside panorama cafe at the top , long queues and we had not booked , would recommend booking if you want to experience either .
NEGATIVE	When they built this cable car they did not plan well for tourists .
NEGATIVE	The cables continuously get in the way of any picture you want to take of the old town of Dubrovnik and it could have been perfect for a beautiful sunset picture but they do not have any viewpoints for sunset .
NEGATIVE	It appears that they are best set up for sunrise as they have a grandstand set up to the east , however i am not sure what time it opens however it might mean you beat the tremendous crowds .
NEGATIVE	Instead you have to hike up out the back a fair way well off the beaten track .
NEGATIVE	It will offer spectacukar views unless it 's rainy and cloudy or foggy lime Fahrenheit we went .
NEGATIVE	In which case it was an hour of my life I can not get back ,
NEGATIVE	Time it so you are walking back down at sunset for amazing panoramic views
NEGATIVE	The cable car is expensive , crammed and ultimately unnecessary .
NEGATIVE	We decided to go up in the cable car and walk back down , but the walk is so nice - and relatively easy - that we wish we 'd walked both ways .
NEGATIVE	Really expensive .
NEGATIVE	Handy for those who can not do the walk but money is a lot .
NEGATIVE	Views are far more spectacular .
NEGATIVE	Climb the mountain by foot if possible .
NEGATIVE	The cafe / restaurant at the top is way overpriced and if you are just getting a drink they make you sit in the back corner .
NEGATIVE	You are not even high enough to see over the cables and the cables run right over the old town below so you can not even get a good picture .
NEGATIVE	If you walk around the cable car building and follow the road , there is a field .
NEGATIVE	The view is not even that great .
NEGATIVE	It is a RIP OFF .
NEGATIVE	It was a great place to watch the sunset .
NEGATIVE	The only thing worth anything at the top of that mountain !
NEGATIVE	You can see better views from road above city coming from kotor .
NEGATIVE	Views obstructed by cables ,
NEGATIVE	I was disappointed .
NEGATIVE	You go up , look around for a few minutes and then come down , not exactly thrilling or worth the money .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride is not more than 2 mins long and It felt like we were in a heard of cattle , as it often does in places over-run with tourists .
NEGATIVE	The view was lovely but once you ’ re at the top there isn ’ t much to do unless you want to sit down for an overpriced lunch .
NEGATIVE	Not worth the $60 round trip for two people .
NEGATIVE	140 kunas or about £18 to get to ride in a cramped space with 30 other people to get to the top of a hill pretty much sums it up .
NEGATIVE	The view at the top is cool we went at around 6 at night it was not too busy and the town was lit up and sun was setting but we avoided the two restaurants at the top that just scream tourist trap .
NEGATIVE	We spent about 15 mins looking at the view and then left ... so again , not worth the money !
NEGATIVE	Long queues to buy tickets .
NEGATIVE	It is bit expensive also .
NEGATIVE	Have seen better views .
NEGATIVE	Cable Car was not too exciting .
NEGATIVE	Should have some sort of ticketing in force as when I was there it was 37 degrees and you just could not stand for that long in the heat people , were melting ! !
NEGATIVE	Did not even manage to get on cable cAr as the queues were just mad ! !
NEGATIVE	We took a ride down with this cable car and we were very disappointed .
NEGATIVE	Considering that the price is about 10 euros we were expecting more than it Just being a transportation means .
NEGATIVE	The trip took a minute or less and it was so crowded that we could not see anything from where we stood .
NEGATIVE	Will not ride again .
NEGATIVE	There are huge queues & when you get to the top the view is great but that 's it & then huge queue to get bank down again .
NEGATIVE	Save your money .
NEGATIVE	There are poor stray dogs at the top that no one seems to want to help or even comment on if you ask about them .
NEGATIVE	It was around 50 gbp for 2 of us the ride took 4 mins each way !
NEGATIVE	Very disappointed . .
NEGATIVE	Poor value and hard to find and not worth the effort !
NEGATIVE	By the time you get to the lower station you might as well continue the walk up .
NEGATIVE	It is a very short ride and quite expensive . 150 kn .
NEGATIVE	Windy and chilly the day in March that I went but they have blankets to keep you cosy while you enjoy .
NEGATIVE	Lovely spot to sit and view the old city .
NEGATIVE	It 's better to do sunset panoramic tours which takes you to many beautiful spots on Srd .
NEGATIVE	Very long queues at the entrance during sunset tine .
NEGATIVE	It 's super expensive for a gondola ride .
NEGATIVE	I give this a two because of the poor service we received at the top .
NEGATIVE	Along with a bunch of other people , we waited in line for 30-45 minutes .
NEGATIVE	However , it started to look stormy and we decided that we should probably take the cable car down the mountain .
NEGATIVE	We had some time to enjoy the sunset ( in July it was about 8:15 p.m. ) .
NEGATIVE	We decided to hike the trail up and be at the top for sunset .
NEGATIVE	We enjoyed the hike with the 16 switchbacks .
NEGATIVE	They would not sell us tickets and would not allow us to get on and buy tickets at the bottom .
NEGATIVE	We walked out , not too happy , and found a number of people sheltering in some buggies still waiting for taxies after 30 minutes .
NEGATIVE	When we reached the top , they had just closed down the ticket office ( even though there were still lots of people to go down and it was not closing time yet ) .
NEGATIVE	After some discussion , they gave us a number to call for a taxi .
NEGATIVE	By 9:45 p.m. , the rain had stopped , and we decided to walk down the trail .
NEGATIVE	We discovered that the museum was still open until 10 pm , so we paid the entry fee there and learned about the 1991 attacks on Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	It was sobering and educational and I would recommend the museum .
NEGATIVE	Fortunately , we had brought flashlights with us .
NEGATIVE	If you booked in advance it might be nice to eat at the restaurant , if you could secure a table with a view , as the prices were the same as in the town .
NEGATIVE	It is hard to take pictures , because of the cable car lines and machinery being strung across your view .
NEGATIVE	The space at the top is small with most of it being taken up by a restaurant .
NEGATIVE	The views from the wall are far better .
NEGATIVE	Alas , you must pay to enter the war exhibit ( which is hidden around the corner and up the dirt path ) - only 30kuna per person but as it was on top of the cable car ride , it made it expensive .
NEGATIVE	It was expensive but we thought a nice cold drink at the top with beautiful views together with a nose around the war exhibit would make it worthwhile .
NEGATIVE	We bought return tickets on a very hot day .
NEGATIVE	Especially since the exhibit seemed a little basic .
NEGATIVE	Old city prices , but you do not have to pay to enter the old city !
NEGATIVE	The souvenir shop did not sell cold bottled drinks as you might hope , and so down we came again .
NEGATIVE	What 's more , the bar at the top of the cable car was extortionate - 57kuna for a bottled beer .
NEGATIVE	Us Yorkshire folk do not like being ripped off .
NEGATIVE	If you are driving , there is a big car park ( rough land ) behind the top of the cable car station .
NEGATIVE	Why not avoid extortionate old town parking costs ( up to 50kuna per hour ) drive up the hill to the top of the cable car , take the car down , explore the old city and then take the cable car back up ?
NEGATIVE	Visit the bakery opposite the cable car ticket office to buy cold drinks and snacks to take up with you 2 .
NEGATIVE	My top tips if you want to go up : 1 .
NEGATIVE	I wish we had ! ! !
NEGATIVE	I would not class this as a must do .
NEGATIVE	If you like aerial views - ok - but I think its a lot of money and £10 for a small beer and a bitter lemon at a stand-up bar was not welcome
NEGATIVE	We tried to get on twice for sunset ( 7.15pm ) and started queueing at 6pm .
NEGATIVE	Couldn ’ t get on either time as was nowhere near the front .
NEGATIVE	Drove instead .
NEGATIVE	Nb .
NEGATIVE	Hairpin bends .
NEGATIVE	Be a confident driver in these conditions or get a cab ! !
NEGATIVE	Single track rubble road .
NEGATIVE	Dinner at the top was alright .
NEGATIVE	Prebook if you don ’ t want to wait .
NEGATIVE	Good views of the town can be got from walking the walls
NEGATIVE	Very expensive with nothing to do once at the top .
NEGATIVE	It ’ s the cruise ships that taint the Dubrovnik experience .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is modern , easy to find and fast though it is very expensive ... It could be fantastic but the panoramic view has a nice view on - the restaurant - the cables of the cable car Means we can not see the old town from there without the cables and we can not see the magic sunset on the El...
NEGATIVE	This is definitelly a bad design and we would not recommend it until they build a proper terrace embrassing the magic view ! !
NEGATIVE	Times that by say 5 ships , then the daily invasion on the 45,000 local populous and families are immense .
NEGATIVE	You have to remember that all these people aren ’ t paying for accommodation locally , or breakfast or indeed dinner .
NEGATIVE	An average cruise ship could hold as many as 5,000 day trippers .
NEGATIVE	We went as a family of 4 .
NEGATIVE	The only way for the local businesses to prosper or pay for the facilities neeed to cope is to charge for it via the attractions that the daily cruise enthusiasts visit .
NEGATIVE	Our 15 year old was charged at an adult price so the 5 minute cable car ride up to the mount of Srd cost us around £100 Sterling or 700kr return .
NEGATIVE	Thus they are busy and expensive .
NEGATIVE	The city walls and the cable car .
NEGATIVE	On a whole there are two they swarm too .
NEGATIVE	The taxi driver points out the local history and what you are looking at AND they stop on the way up where the best place is to take advantage of a good photo is . ( It ’ s not st the top as you might think ) In the cable car it ’ s crowded and only the first 4 in get in a position to see the view ....
NEGATIVE	At the top your panoramic photos are spoiled by the cable car posts and wires .
NEGATIVE	Compare that to a taxi , which is about 50Kr return or £8.50 , then you can see the difference for yourself .
NEGATIVE	Remember it ’ s the same view at the top .
NEGATIVE	Top tip - save yourself some time queuing , a lot of money and a disappointment and get a taxi .
NEGATIVE	Every review you wil read here will talk about the view NOBODY describes the the journey , so no need to break the bank to get there .
NEGATIVE	The professional promotional photos of Dubrovnik are actually taken half way down the hill .
NEGATIVE	The view was great but there is nothing to do when you are up there so we just waited for the next cable car to take us back down .
NEGATIVE	I am terrified of heights so was practically forced in to this trip !
NEGATIVE	Would not bother going up there again .
NEGATIVE	Probably to do if never took a cable car in your life , or if you want to share a small room with a lot of rude chinese or korean tourist
NEGATIVE	The view from the cable car is quite good .
NEGATIVE	There nothing else once you get up to the top .
NEGATIVE	But then I 'd say that 's about it .
NEGATIVE	There is a amphitheatre but when we visited it was not really active
NEGATIVE	Just a restaurant with limited vegetarian options and a souvenir store .
NEGATIVE	Or going by car in order to avoid waiting so long because of the huge amount of people .
NEGATIVE	I agree , it 's nice to see the city from the top .
NEGATIVE	But you can see it from many other spots , for free .
NEGATIVE	And the cable car is really expensive !
NEGATIVE	We came here during the " off-peak " seasons , still we spent more time queuing for the rides ( up and down ) than enjoying the view , which probably is not the best place anyway - a bit too far away from the town .
NEGATIVE	Up on the top was fully packed with tourist like us , and there is not a proper space to queue ... It 's not worth its price in my opinion .
NEGATIVE	The view definitely wasnt worth the money we paid to get up there .
NEGATIVE	We preferred actually walking around the city walls .
NEGATIVE	We arrived at around 9:30 /10:00am and there was already a queue .
NEGATIVE	However , shortly after we arrived various tour groups also came .
NEGATIVE	If you are going to do this , either come early or a lot later on in the afternoon .
NEGATIVE	We enjoyed the view , but was glad to get out at the top as the cable car is not air conditioned .
NEGATIVE	We thought we would get some pictures going up the cable car , however the cables blocked any good pictures .
NEGATIVE	Views are pretty from the top , however we much preferred the city walls tour and the view of the city walls from the fort .
NEGATIVE	Overall , we thought this was expensive for what it was
NEGATIVE	About 20 + people were squished into a hot sweaty cable car which took a short ride to the top .
NEGATIVE	The views were lovely but I still think it was expensive for what it was .
NEGATIVE	The trip up and down cost 140 Kuna each ( £18 ) .
NEGATIVE	You pay a lot for go up and when yopu arrive there .... nothing ! you can just take some photos ( if you are lucky and there is no fog ) and after 30 min come back to Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	I took the cable car one day , to visit Dubrovnik from the top of the montain .
NEGATIVE	There is one small bar at arrival , but is expensive and you can just sit and look the cloud ( I was unlucky that day ... ) .
NEGATIVE	Not particularly good views on the way up and a concrete plinth with a cafe and gift shop at top .
NEGATIVE	Better to go up by car or take a taxi if there are a few of you .
NEGATIVE	Very expensive and disappointing .
NEGATIVE	The cost at nearly £11 each person is not worth it .
NEGATIVE	Save your money for a boat trip ! !
NEGATIVE	We did the Old Town Wall walk then the day after took the cable car and was disappointed as the views are not as good , There is a restaurant up there but wise to book if you want a good seat or not have to line up and wait for a table
NEGATIVE	The one redeeming factor , and with our interests , it was a definite positive , the museum at the fort on the summit which detailed , in part at least and with a distinctive editorial bias , the appalling siege of Dubrovnik some twenty or so years ago .
NEGATIVE	However for the price of an aerial view of the city , we could have had a darn-good meal somewhere , and for this alone , we felt fleeced .
NEGATIVE	Dubrovnik is undoubtedly a beautiful old city .
NEGATIVE	Cable cars are now a tourist attraction the world over .
NEGATIVE	All in all , go up the cable car if a ) money is no object , or b ) you absolutely love cable cars or c ) you want to find out more ( albeit the local slant ) about the horrors of the ' homeland war ' of 1991-1992 .
NEGATIVE	On the other hand , a great meal is a great meal !
NEGATIVE	There was some English translation with the collection of news photography and other exhibits , and the TV news reels were all in English since they comprised entirely , the edited footage of ITN 's reporter on the ground at the time , Paul Davies .
NEGATIVE	I cant recommend this , it takes a coupleof minutes to get up , look down on Dubrovnik and then get back in and go back down , rather expensive for what it is , when you can do bus tour and see it along the way and cheaper .
NEGATIVE	The view from the upper station of the Cable Car is fantastic , and every visitor to the city must be there .
NEGATIVE	The Cable Car itself is not such a special experience at all .
NEGATIVE	If possible , I recommend to get there by car and save the money for the restaurant up there ...
NEGATIVE	There are numerous wires that obstruct the view of Old Town down the foot of the hill .
NEGATIVE	Very disappointed .
NEGATIVE	Overpriced and have to wait for ages to actually get into the carts .
NEGATIVE	Thoroughly disappointed .
NEGATIVE	The views once up are nice however jam packed with tourists . 15 minutes is enough to see what you paid $50 - $60 for 2 people .
NEGATIVE	Do not waste your money take a taxi to a hilltop instead Also the operators look like the Croatian mafia and look very unpleasant
NEGATIVE	Well , we thought why not , might get some nice views .
NEGATIVE	And the cable cars are packed with tourists clicking away , well , it was peak season .
NEGATIVE	Well , you do , of the cable wires / pillars while you go up and down .
NEGATIVE	Best to buy your tickets at the cable car gates NOT at the main road as they only take cash , where as at the main entrance you can pay by card .
NEGATIVE	When at the top the best views are if you walk away from the main buildings as most tourists take photos from the main viewing points then get the next cable cart back down !
NEGATIVE	You can also walk up / down but that would take too long or get a taxi one way and cable cart the other and it works out cheaper than a return tram ticket .
NEGATIVE	There is a museum at the top , but you have to pay extra to go inside .
NEGATIVE	What 's that about !
NEGATIVE	Overall , could have saved our money and had a nice meal , as once at top it 's just barren rock , and unless you have a selfie stick you will just get pictures of the other tourists and the cable cart pillars .
NEGATIVE	Where sensible foot wear if you decide to walk away from the main building to get that all important picture .
NEGATIVE	We did !
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately this event was not all it was made out to be .
NEGATIVE	There was nothing to do at the top .
NEGATIVE	Better views can be seen from the water if Dubrovnik and surrounding area .
NEGATIVE	For a family of 6,this was extremely expensive at 170kn per adult and 60kn per child ( 3&3 ) there really should be a family ticket available , , ets face it 3 kids aged between 8-11 are not particularly interested in sightseeing but too young to be left alone .
NEGATIVE	As this has been described as a must do experience , we chose to spend the money but we are all disappointed .
NEGATIVE	The short trip is soon over and the first viewing platform does provide a pretty scenic view but somewhat ruined by the cable car wires that go across the main part of the land scenery ( especially when trying to get a good spot for a photo around many other Tourists ) the upper platform shows a wor...
NEGATIVE	We walked someway down for more scenic views , but this is not signposted so just go for a stroll .
NEGATIVE	We felt we had to find more as we 'd paid 690kn for family ! ! ( £80-£90 ) I did not see any literature about dubrovnik or the sights that you could see - no signage for a walkway down with extra ' quieter ' views and non leaflets pointing out particular areas or regions towards the mountain area ( ...
NEGATIVE	I would not suggest this is a ' must do ' experience - definitely not for families with younger children - due to the over priced tickets and the whole trip up , photo opportunity , trip down could be done in half hour .
NEGATIVE	Safe the money and do the city wall walk .
NEGATIVE	Yes , you do have a nice view .
NEGATIVE	But you have that pretty much everywhere in Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Do not waste your time in the " museum " .
NEGATIVE	The view is nice but you can drive or walk to the top easily .
NEGATIVE	It 's a very short , very expensive ride .
NEGATIVE	I would skip it if I had known .
NEGATIVE	It was very expensive to use the cable car and when you get to the top the views are certainly excellent but it does not take long to take it all in .
NEGATIVE	There is a restaurant if you want to stay longer and I guess that would make it more worthwhile , but of course at an extra price .
NEGATIVE	I personally thought it was overpriced for what it was . 149.00 kunas .
NEGATIVE	The queues to get up and down were horrendous ! !
NEGATIVE	The views were fantastic though and a great photo opportunity .
NEGATIVE	When you got to the top it also cost another 30 kunas to get In the fort .
NEGATIVE	It was good to see the old town from the highest point but the gift shop is disappointing and the cable car only runs every 30 mins .
NEGATIVE	I would not bother with it unless the price goes down .
NEGATIVE	It was 96 kuna per adult which was a lot to go up a hill and back down .
NEGATIVE	The cables from the cable car also are in every picture , detracting from the aesthetics .
NEGATIVE	Nice view over the old town and into neighboring Bosnia and Herzegovina , but you get as good a view driving in or strolling up a hill in town , and a better view overall from the city walls .
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately this is a must-do .
NEGATIVE	Alternatively drive to the upper hills and view from there .
NEGATIVE	The view is great but the cable car ride is purely functional - it ’ s over in around four minutes .
NEGATIVE	You could walk up the steep hill but with 32 degrees heat , and kids , you won ’ t enjoy it .
NEGATIVE	At around £2 - £3 per minute ride , this is on par with a fairground ride without any thrills .
NEGATIVE	The view from the summit is spectacular .
NEGATIVE	It is too high for a short ride . 130 HRK adult return , 80 HRK adult one way , 60 HRK for child above 4-yr .
NEGATIVE	Had I knew this , I would have taken a taxi which would have been cheaper for the family .
NEGATIVE	But the cable car price is a big con .
NEGATIVE	You can also walk thru a gravel path upwards .
NEGATIVE	You can take car up to the summit .
NEGATIVE	Going down took us 45-50 minutes .
NEGATIVE	Walking up will take 1-1.5 hour .
NEGATIVE	What I am getting at is no matter where you stand or view the city the cables that bring the cars up obscure every single view .
NEGATIVE	I do not know who the idiot was who thought it was a good idea to design the cable car so the old city was one side of the cables and the viewing platform the other .
NEGATIVE	There are two viewing platforms so you would think the higher of the two would be built out over the lower one and the area the cars arrive so you could get an uninterrupted view BUT no the higher platform is built further back than the lower one so any photo not only has the cables but also the hea...
NEGATIVE	Its not even an interesting ride u , the car moves quickly and about 4 people in a full car can see anything but then again those damn cables are in every shot .
NEGATIVE	This added nothing to any impression I had of Dubrovnik , the walk around the city walls was a much better way to see over the old city .
NEGATIVE	The museum at the top wasn ’ t even included an at almost £20per person !
NEGATIVE	Ok , so get a good view ...... but at a hell of a price !
NEGATIVE	Really feel this was tourism exploitation .
NEGATIVE	Took cable car to top of Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	This was not to exciting .
NEGATIVE	As I have plenty of experience from skiing with gondolas and trams .
NEGATIVE	Not much extra to see or experience that you can not see from the city and walls .
NEGATIVE	The view from the top is mainly obstructed by the cable car towers and wires unless you are prepared to climb onto the rocks .
NEGATIVE	We decided to take a ride up the cable car to get some views of the city !
NEGATIVE	There are so many people up there that it 's almost impossible to get a good picture .
NEGATIVE	We wanted to have a drink at the top and the restaurant staff are only really interested in the people dining !
NEGATIVE	In my opinion the best views are from the city walls .
NEGATIVE	The queue to get down was also very long !
NEGATIVE	This was not worth the money !
NEGATIVE	tourist trap , i think this is over priced for what it is , sure you get nice views from the top but its over priced and there is nothing once you are on the top , just a view and its the same view you can get anywhere in Dubrovnik
NEGATIVE	Literally in it for 5 mins and it costs £20 a head return .
NEGATIVE	We were going to restaurant panorama and took cable car up .
NEGATIVE	Next time we will take our taxi here or walk ! ! !
NEGATIVE	Wish we had not : the cable car is overpriced for what you get , which is packed in like sardines , so much that you can not see anything if you are not one of the people near the windows .
NEGATIVE	We hiked up to the fort via the well maintained trail and then took the cable car down .
NEGATIVE	We wish we would have just hiked down the trail instead of taking the cable car .
NEGATIVE	We took the bus 17 to Bosanka and walked to the cable car view point .
NEGATIVE	The queue is also very long and the amount of time you sent up there is only 10mins , there ’ s not a lot to do other than to take photos and go to the panorama bar .
NEGATIVE	This is not a bad activity , just very much over priced and the photo shots from up the hill will include the lines for the cable cars .
NEGATIVE	It was a rather tough climb but nice and much better views on the walk than on top of the canle car view point .
NEGATIVE	We took the cable car back down ( 90 kn per person ) and it was convenient , but quite fast and not that pleasant .
NEGATIVE	You can get a better view of the city if you go to Fort Lovrijenac plus the price is already included in the city wall price .
NEGATIVE	If you want the view of the city with no electric cables in your frame go to the fort recommended .
NEGATIVE	The bus 17 does not go that often , and our first bus just didnt arrive .
NEGATIVE	But be prepared to pay the ‘ tourist price ’ .
NEGATIVE	It 's only 3 minutes each way with a very average lookout and a souvenir shop .
NEGATIVE	Walking back would have been unfeasible so cable car was great on that front .
NEGATIVE	We went early evening to see the sunset therefore skip the cruise ship queues .
NEGATIVE	Unless you book the very expensive restaurant there is nothing else .
NEGATIVE	Do not waste your money a real Dubrovnik tourist trap .
NEGATIVE	Do not go out of your way for it .
NEGATIVE	If you like cable cars by all means take this ride but generally its nothing special .
NEGATIVE	I dont usually put people off about anything but i did not think the cable car was worth 120 kunas return for ... had good views of the city but much prefer walking on the city walls for that .
NEGATIVE	Went for a drink & quick bite in the restaurant that was expensive which was to be expected .... maybe recommend it if run out of things to do & if yr not put off by the money ....
NEGATIVE	I heard there is a museum which we went to the main one in old town anyway .
NEGATIVE	Quick journey up and down .
NEGATIVE	Not much to do when u get up .
NEGATIVE	Easy to find , you go up very fast ... yes the view is great but if you have a rented car better drive up there ... the restaurant there also is so overpriced ... tourist expoitation at its worst
NEGATIVE	Had hoped for a cold beer at the top , the service was so haphazzard that after waiting 15 minutes left and went back down the cable car .
NEGATIVE	Signage is not the best
NEGATIVE	Staying in Dubrovnik for 4 days we expected to take in the cable car and get some great sunset pics etc ... Our first attempt was cancelled due to high winds it was not running .
NEGATIVE	Then over the next couple of days - low clouds hung over the hilltops , so that , although it was sunny , there was really no view from the top .
NEGATIVE	So , my advise , is not to get to obsessed with getting that great view of Dubrovnik . .
NEGATIVE	It may not happen
NEGATIVE	The queues to go up and come down are crazy .
NEGATIVE	At the top , the queue to come down is on the same staircase you use for the viewing terrace and you get abuse from people waiting for the car who think you are queue jumping as you have to by pass them to get to the terrace .
NEGATIVE	The cable car can not cope with the number of cruise ships which inundate this city .
NEGATIVE	We got a taxi up and walked down getting far better obscured views .
NEGATIVE	The view is obscured by the cables at the top .
NEGATIVE	Avoid
NEGATIVE	I think a kuna is about $.20 .
NEGATIVE	The cost was 87 kuna per person .
NEGATIVE	So it costs about $17 to take the cable car .
NEGATIVE	I think a taxi to the top is even more expensive .
NEGATIVE	If you are not part of a big tour group , they take you last .
NEGATIVE	They pack you into the cable car like sardines .
NEGATIVE	It wasn ’ t as neat as I thought that it would be and therefore I don ’ t recommend it .
NEGATIVE	Getting on the cable car last guarantees that you don ’ t get a good view and therefore unable to take pictures .
NEGATIVE	There ’ s a restaurant , gift shop , and bathrooms at the top .
NEGATIVE	Even if you are standing in line before everyone else , the tour groups still go first .
NEGATIVE	There were tour groups that “ cut in front of us ” on the way up and the way down .
NEGATIVE	The view of Dubrovnik was still neat from on top but not worth the money .
NEGATIVE	We bought tickets at one of the outlets about 100 metres from the cable car which made it quicker to access the car .
NEGATIVE	We followed the advice give here and bought tickets for the ride up and walked down .
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately it was packed and allowing babies on In strollers seemed silly as it made it more crowded , lessening the floor space but not the head count .
NEGATIVE	When you get to the top there are just nice views and a shop and cafe .
NEGATIVE	Only a short wait while they cleaned the car which was spotless .
NEGATIVE	The ride is not 3.5 mins as stated unless you count loading and unloading the car .
NEGATIVE	There is a cross and altar but no explanation as to why .
NEGATIVE	The Napoleonic Fort houses a basic but interesting exhibition about the 1991 war .
NEGATIVE	It is all loose rocks underfoot with some sheer side drops so don ’ t do it at night or in sandals and hang on to small children !
NEGATIVE	The walk down was an experience and took us an hour but I am scared of heights so took it slowly .
NEGATIVE	This is a further 30 KN per person but if you don ’ t see that there no point in going .
NEGATIVE	So , if you have time and are fit ; walk up , see the war exhibition , take pictures and walk down .
NEGATIVE	I consider a cost of 12,5 EUR per person for a ride in a tightly packed cable car lasting about one minute either way highly overpriced , even compared to western european standards .
NEGATIVE	In my opinion you can enjoy equally beautiful views of Dubrovnik from atop its walls , especially from the platform of Minceta tower .
NEGATIVE	although we get great views of the city of Dubrovnik from the very elevated levels I would think this one can be avoided as if you have a car and drive a little bit out on both sides of the city you could get similar views of the city
NEGATIVE	The views are good , but obstructed by cable lines .
NEGATIVE	And it is too expensive for such a short ride .
NEGATIVE	Nothing much to do up there , only spent 15 minutes before coming back down .
NEGATIVE	We took the cable car ascent in the afternoon after climbing the old town walls .
NEGATIVE	The cost was just over €22 per person and the climb too about 4 minutes .
NEGATIVE	Once at the top the views were not as amazing as one would expect and actually we got much better photos from the town walls themselves .
NEGATIVE	We got back to the bottom feeling a little bit robbed and disappointed .
NEGATIVE	It was around $25 each for a nice view and an expensive restaurant at the top .
NEGATIVE	It 's not worth the cost to go up the cable car .
NEGATIVE	Not worth it .
NEGATIVE	The cable car experience was ok , especially when it broke down and we had to wait at the top for over 45 minutes for it to start working again .
NEGATIVE	They should also place some fans or open windows for the hot season .
NEGATIVE	For what they charge for the lift ticket , they should clean the windows at all times so you can get nice pictures while in the cable car .
NEGATIVE	It 's the view at the top that is beautiful the cable car is not so amazing .
NEGATIVE	Unfortunately can not put a photo on as the cable cars held 30 people crushed like sardines .
NEGATIVE	For a family of 4 it costs £50 so the cab is cheaper .
NEGATIVE	Great views when you eventually arrive at the top
NEGATIVE	The view from the top if great .
NEGATIVE	Alot could be learned from Barcelona .
NEGATIVE	You can drive up their too if you are scared of cable cars .
NEGATIVE	The queue was not bad but they squashed us in and we did not see much because of all the people and it took about 3 mins to get the top so flashed before our eyes .
NEGATIVE	We ended up eating in the wonderful Panarama restaurant which made it very worthwhile .
NEGATIVE	At the top the view is wonderful .
NEGATIVE	Everyone suggested taking the cable car ride when in Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	While it gives you a great perspective of the city , frankly the whole experience is slightly overrated .
NEGATIVE	We decided to go early to avoid the queues and heat , and arrived at the lower ticketing offices just a five mins walk from the castle walls .
NEGATIVE	But if you walk to the actual cable base , they do accept cards .
NEGATIVE	Well , all we can say is , that 's 170kruna each we will never see again .
NEGATIVE	And they do not accept cards .
NEGATIVE	So cash it was .
NEGATIVE	At the top most rushed out to get clicking , but to be honest yes you see Dubrovnik , but it is blighted by the cable wires and pillars .
NEGATIVE	To be honest , it was not my choice to go , but most on TripAdvisor say you get a great view , so we thought ok let us do this .
NEGATIVE	And there was a queue , and we were packed in like cattle , and it was hot , so no view at all bar the back of other visitors heads .
NEGATIVE	There is also a small museum of the Battle for homeland , yet you have to pay extra !
NEGATIVE	If you want to get any clear views take a walk away from the main building to avoid the crowds and wiring .
NEGATIVE	So get your timing right if you want a better view .
NEGATIVE	Much cheaper if you share a taxi there and back .
NEGATIVE	Most people after taking photo 's rushed back onto the cable cars to go back down .
NEGATIVE	You also have the option of walking up or down , or even getting a taxi .
NEGATIVE	Over all , 3 out of 10 .
NEGATIVE	Too many people clicking away , and you get to see well above Dubrovnik , but be cheaper to buy a post card for that view .
NEGATIVE	Why , nothing to do at the top , bar have a drink at the posh restaurant or cafe , and it , 's barren .
NEGATIVE	We went one sunny morning , queued up and after about 10 minutes were told it was shut due to high winds .
NEGATIVE	For the price that this is , 120 kuna for an adult , I do not think it was worth it .
NEGATIVE	Cue major disappointment .
NEGATIVE	We went back into the old town and after a few hours noticed it was running again , so walked back up the hill to see if we could get on .
NEGATIVE	Yes it is a nice view , but apart from that , there is nothing else to see or do up there .
NEGATIVE	Now , it was much windier than earlier , but now it was running .
NEGATIVE	Our whole trip only lasted about 15-20 minutes .
NEGATIVE	Nice views from the top and good restuarant there too but very expensive considering the economy and local wages .
NEGATIVE	Ripping tourists off has been the theme here in Dubrovnik and this attraction is just another way .
NEGATIVE	Was hard to find out why ~ even locals we asked , were unsure why . . hmm . . not such a great winter resort after allm many old town shops were ' closed ' through all of Dec too . .
NEGATIVE	Wishing I could share experience . . but unfortunately cable car was " not running " while we stayed in dubrovnik over xmas !
NEGATIVE	The cafe is built on the left of the cable car and the sunset is on the right side , you can not actually see the sun setting from there and the cable car lines are in the way anyhow !
NEGATIVE	You can take some decent pictures of the dry hills behind , but they are not really much of a bargain .
NEGATIVE	You get much better views for a similar price from the walls surrounding the town .
NEGATIVE	The view is nice BUT the cable car lines ruin the view of old town and everything else !
NEGATIVE	The sea looks nice , and you can see islands .
NEGATIVE	Hefty price for a 4 minute ride .
NEGATIVE	It 's like visiting Niagara Falls , after ten minutes you are done .
NEGATIVE	That 's it .
NEGATIVE	The view of the old town is pretty much ruined by gondola cables , and it 's too far below , making photos problematic .
NEGATIVE	Better view from the actual cable car ride if you are on the right side .
NEGATIVE	Would I do it again or recommend it ?
NEGATIVE	No.
NEGATIVE	It ’ s ok but I would skip if u are limited for time .
NEGATIVE	I could have done without the spending 60 usd for two and not much to do up there .
NEGATIVE	Postcard view .
NEGATIVE	30min queue in the rain to get up .
NEGATIVE	Nice view but not worth the cost and would skip in bad weather .
NEGATIVE	The cable car took about 4 mins . 20 min queue to get back down .
NEGATIVE	Heading into our trip to Dubrovnik , this seemed like a " must-see " .
NEGATIVE	After experiencing it , I can say it really was not .
NEGATIVE	I would have given this a three star rating if it cost a bit less , but charging 140 kuna / person for this is a bit of a rip off .
NEGATIVE	The view was nice but not all it was cracked up to be - the best view is actually obstructed by a bunch of cable car lines .
NEGATIVE	We queued in the melting heat and were very disappointed with what was before us when you got to the top .
NEGATIVE	It was all badly managed and very chaotic
NEGATIVE	When you get up there it 's likely that unless you are very pushy , someone with a selfie stick will end up in your panoramic shot from up the top .
NEGATIVE	The view when you get up there is nice , but if you come in on the bus , you have seen about all you are going to see - the orange roofs and walls from the top .
NEGATIVE	Really expensive - especially if you are on a backpacker 's budget .
NEGATIVE	Walk up , hitch-hike up , but do not spend the money unless you have got nothing else to spend it on .
NEGATIVE	The cable car offers great views over Dubrovnik but it is simply over priced for what it is .
NEGATIVE	Its a lot cheaper and you get better views buy walking to the top .
NEGATIVE	First thing that hit you was the price . 140 kuna each return gives you 4 minutes each way on the car , views are great at top but either drive or get a taxi , by the time you queue you could be there and back !
NEGATIVE	As we had a hire car we actually started from the top .
NEGATIVE	Good view though !
NEGATIVE	it was waste of money i had a better view from my room , the cable car was full of people and the ones in the middle can not see anything the distance is very short and we were standing as there is no place to sit and i could not breath as there was many people in the car
NEGATIVE	Cheaper option would be to take number 17 bus from old town .
NEGATIVE	We were crammed into the cable car so could not see much of the view .
NEGATIVE	Very expensive for what it is .
NEGATIVE	The Mt Srd scenery and the Homeland War are great reasons to go visit the fortress , but waiting for a cable car can be exhausting .
NEGATIVE	My recommendation is to take a taxi to the top and enjoy the walk down .
NEGATIVE	We were really looking forward to watching the sun set from the viewing platform but the site is really badly laid out as the view is spoilt by the cables situated between the viewing platform and the setting sun .
NEGATIVE	The sun sets in the same direction every day but whoever designed the visitor area overlooked this .
NEGATIVE	It was expensive at 120 kuna per person for a disappointing experience .
NEGATIVE	At 150 kuna return it is very expensive for a 3 minute ride each way .
NEGATIVE	Sometimes there is a long wait in a queue at peak times .
NEGATIVE	There are taxis that will charge alot less than this .
NEGATIVE	First of all in the morning till after 3pm you have to wait in a line .
NEGATIVE	Yes the view upstairs is better then ons the ground but not spectacular .
NEGATIVE	I can not recommend it without dry eyes .
NEGATIVE	When it 's your turn you get shoved in one cablecar and up you go .
NEGATIVE	Extortionate price for a few minutes on the cable car ... The views are good from the top but does not warrant price ... Walk up or get a cab !
NEGATIVE	Although the cable car is great and a fast way up the mountain , there is a visitor-friendly path that goes there as well .
NEGATIVE	Not as impressive as the view from the city walls , this point view is certainly beautiful and lets you see Dubrovnik from another perspective .
NEGATIVE	Cable car offers nice ride on the top of the mountain Srd but I think the tickets are way over priced !
NEGATIVE	Although not suggested when the sun is shining around noon , the walk is pretty easy and takes about an hour up .
NEGATIVE	After some staircases in the city itself , the path zigzags its way up to the cable car 's point view ( no fee ) .
NEGATIVE	Nice restaurant with terrasse giving on the view on top .
NEGATIVE	But still better to use cable car than drive up with car alone as road is pretty dangerous .
NEGATIVE	This cable-car , while convenient , is quite expensive for a return ticket .
NEGATIVE	There is no doubting the views of the old town are the best from the top of the mountain , however my recommendation is to walk up the mountain in the morning when the sun is just cresting behind the mountain - best photos , and you are not rushed by the cable car .
NEGATIVE	Tour the incredible war museum at the top ( in the ruined looking fortress ) and then catch the cable car down .
NEGATIVE	It is much better to rent a car for 1 day and visit all attractions in Dubrovnik for few hours only .
NEGATIVE	Not reasonable price for a ride with a cable car .
NEGATIVE	The Cable Car is conveniently located and a direct route up to the viewing point but the ' cabin ' itself takes up to 32 people and unless if you are one of the lucky 5 you will not get much of a view and the view from the cabin is no greater than the spectacular view from the top .
NEGATIVE	Many recommended the sunset but the sunset is arguably better from sea level so I 'd recommend taking a taxi to / from the top and enjoy the sunset at sea level .
NEGATIVE	Many people had made , in my opinion , the wiser decision of taking a taxi to the top .
NEGATIVE	Cable cars offer the best view of Dubrovnik so worth a visit .
NEGATIVE	At the top there is a cafe restaurant and a shop .
NEGATIVE	It 's a nice view but feels very touristy with lack lustre offerings at the top .
NEGATIVE	Still worth doing though .
NEGATIVE	Even though we visited at the end lf October we were still crammed into a cable car with over 10 other people which meant we did not get a good view going up nor down .
NEGATIVE	For me , i was a little dissapointed and did not think it was worth the money when you can get just as nice pictures when walking round the walls of the old city .
NEGATIVE	However , at the top it is fantastic views and you can go for a nice walk or have a coffee ( if you fancy paying over the odds ) .
NEGATIVE	My partner enjoyed it more than me but he too found it was a little pricey for what it was ...
NEGATIVE	Some interesting history at the fortress re surge on Dubrovnik in the early 90s .
NEGATIVE	I was not a big fan of this ... views are cool , but I did not think it was worth the time or money unless you have multiple days in Dubrovnik and time to spare , and you really like the sky view thing .
NEGATIVE	The cable car tower and wire position makes it tough to get an unobstructed view of the old town .
NEGATIVE	We went around 5pm in May , so sun was pretty good .
NEGATIVE	If you do not like to walk or can not then it is OK .
NEGATIVE	This is a costly cable car ride .
NEGATIVE	There are so many wonderful things to do and see in Dubrovnik with great views or cultural importance , this should be low on the list .
NEGATIVE	Also there are lines for this .
NEGATIVE	I was so shocked at the incredibly rude lady supposedly selling tickets at the cable car , it really spoiled my experience . ( this was at the actual cable car itself , not a secondary seller ) She stopped the queue to do her paperwork for a full 10 minutes , so everyone waiting missed 2 cable cars ...
NEGATIVE	She was the only person on duty , so this was unbelievable .
NEGATIVE	Even the guys loading the cable cars tried to talk to her with no luck .
NEGATIVE	The views are beautiful , but it 's a shame they so not treat their customers better , or appreciate visitors who are paying a lot of money .
NEGATIVE	When you do finally reach the top there is no where to buy anything to drink , not even a bottle of water , except the very expensive restaurant .
NEGATIVE	It 's 120 kuna for a round trip ticket and there is absolutely nothing to see up top .
NEGATIVE	For Crotia this is quite expensive .
NEGATIVE	There is nothing really out of the ordinary special about this attraction and I 'd say save your money and choose another thing to do .
NEGATIVE	It 's a nice view but Dubrovnik has nice views on normal roads that actually beat this .
NEGATIVE	We went for a sunset ride up to the Panorama Restaurant for cocktails and did not have much time to take in the views and snap some pictures before it was over .
NEGATIVE	The cable car is quite expensive and does not last very long at all .
NEGATIVE	We were a family of 6 - 3 adults and 3 children - total 690 kunar - £ 80-90 .
NEGATIVE	View could be stunning but they have built the cable car so the cables are right in the view of all photographs .
NEGATIVE	We walked all round the back to try and find a spot to photograph without the cables .
NEGATIVE	A lot of money for a short cable car ride .
NEGATIVE	There were no signs indicating what any of the buildings in the city were that we could see - or where Montenegro or Bosnia And Herzegovina were .
NEGATIVE	At the top looking away from the city was totally undeveloped - just hillside - not particularly attractive .
NEGATIVE	All facilities at the top had to be paid for over and above the cable car cost .
NEGATIVE	We could have been up and down within half an hour having done all we wanted .
NEGATIVE	No information at all to help .
NEGATIVE	Cable car cost a total of 300 Kuna return for both me and my wife .
NEGATIVE	Takes about 2 minuets each way and although the views are spectacular the price does not include the museum at the top !
NEGATIVE	Buy a postcard with a picture of the view and save your money !
NEGATIVE	Although its a nice enough view from the top I found the cost of the cable car was very expensive for two adulys and a child .
NEGATIVE	As other reviewers have said , there isnt much to do up there once you have seen the view unless you want to visit the war museum but that costs extra .
NEGATIVE	The destination is fantastic ( restaurant and views ) , but the cable car itself was 100 Euros for 4 adults and 2 children - it stuck out in Croatia as unexpectedly overpriced .
NEGATIVE	If you are limited on time I would pass on this as the city has so much else to offer .
NEGATIVE	No denying the view is great but I do not think the wait , walk to catch the cable car and the cost were worth it .
NEGATIVE	Alternatively , you can get a bus part of the way but getting there also involves quite a steep 10-15 minute walk .
NEGATIVE	We did not get to take the cable car due to the weather , but , the ride is around 18 euros , ( there have been 2 price increases in this year alone ) , you can do a trip including transport for 36 euros from the hotel .
NEGATIVE	It was over priced and the lines were long and it was hot !
NEGATIVE	Pay a taxi the same amount and get driven up to the top .
NEGATIVE	Once you arrive at the top , any chance for a descent photo of the city is ruined by the cable car wires , so you have to walk down the mountain to get them out of your view .
NEGATIVE	We took the cable car to the top ; however , once we arrived there we realized we could have driven or taken a taxi for far less .
NEGATIVE	There are far better options to get to this view .
NEGATIVE	I would have saved my money and traveled by car .
NEGATIVE	Due to the weather the cable car was not working when we got there .
NEGATIVE	It was too much wind and they had to stop it from running .
NEGATIVE	It gives you a clear view of the entire old town .
NEGATIVE	If it works you should consider doing it and make reservation for the restuarant at the top .
NEGATIVE	Awesome .
NEGATIVE	Restaurant seemed decent and busy but other than that doubt I would bother except for a panoramic photo
NEGATIVE	Sadly you couldn ' see the sunset even tho the marketing material promised it .
NEGATIVE	Nice view tho !
NEGATIVE	Way to excpencive for a 3 min ride up to the top .
NEGATIVE	Basicly you cat get up to Srd with a car or a cab and have a burger and a cola in the restoran with a view to the city .
NEGATIVE	Or you can walk up .
NEGATIVE	Overpriced for the value you get .
NEGATIVE	Taking cable car has no sense .
NEGATIVE	Takes you 45 minutes .
NEGATIVE	Better value view from the fort which is included in the ticket for the city walls .
NEGATIVE	It seemed far too much money for nothing more than a good view over the area .
NEGATIVE	We visited Dubrovnik by boat from Cavtat and once there decided to go on the cable car .
NEGATIVE	You go out of the old town and then it 's roughly a 7 minute walk to get to the cable car site .
NEGATIVE	What a let down ! !
NEGATIVE	There are better ways to spend your cash whilst there .
NEGATIVE	Once on it , it 's standing room only so difficult to see out unless you are by the window and the ride itself is very quick and in my view , expensive .
NEGATIVE	I certainly would not recommend .
NEGATIVE	There are loads of steps to get up to the base station , so if you would struggle with that just get a taxi up to the start .
NEGATIVE	We were staying in Cavtat and getting the bus in allowed us to get ' birds eye ' views of the old town for free .
NEGATIVE	You can buy tickets from anywhere , they are all the same price .
NEGATIVE	The cable car cost a fortune and just gave the same view .
NEGATIVE	It 's spotlessly clean and well organised .
NEGATIVE	My friend got the cable car up and walked down in about an hour , really enjoyed it and the changing views .
NEGATIVE	You 'd need good shoes , it 's not a formal tarmac path .
NEGATIVE	Although this was highly recommended in our travel book , We weren ’ t too impressed .
NEGATIVE	All of us thought it was a waste of time .
NEGATIVE	Instead of taking the Cable Car I would recommend taking a taxi ( there is a taxi stand right opposite to the Cable Car office ) , it only cost us 350 Kunas for 4 of us for the return trip .
NEGATIVE	The driver waited for us for 30 minuets at Hotel Panorama .
NEGATIVE	I had previously been to the top of the hill to Hotel Panorama using the Cable car but it cost me 150 Croatian Kunas .
NEGATIVE	This time I travelled with my family which would have costed me 600 Kunas in total .
NEGATIVE	Would highly recommend taking a cab which can be found easily and save some busks as it a great ride as well .
NEGATIVE	I only asked if we could stop at few other sunset points and he showed us better spots as well .
NEGATIVE	We also saw Bosnian villages from the taxi .
NEGATIVE	You get better views from the city from the North-West tower on the city walls , or from Fort Lovrijenac ( and I suspect you can also get some great views from the D8 main road - but I confess , we did not stop to confirm ) .
NEGATIVE	The ride up is reasonably expensive and the cable car cable cuts through any potential view of the city .
NEGATIVE	Lots of people say that the Dubrovnick cable car is a must-do whilst in the city .
NEGATIVE	Believe me , it is not really worth it .
NEGATIVE	Sadly this appears to be a cynical scheme to extort unreasonable charges from gullible tourists , which does not reflect well on the City .
NEGATIVE	The views are spectacular although they do not offer a great deal more than the wonderful views from the various vantage points around the Old Town .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride is very short , you have to queue for a while and they cram so many of you in that its quite likely you will not be anywhere near the windows to enjoy the view .
NEGATIVE	After spending a week in Croatia this is the only time me and my friend felt a bit ripped off .
NEGATIVE	At the top , there is a restaurant , viewing platform , a gift shop and not a great deal else .
NEGATIVE	To feel like we got our money 's worth we spent half an hour walking the surrounding area then went back down .
NEGATIVE	But I was keen to seen the Homelands War exhibits but was far too expensive .
NEGATIVE	On our next visit we will walk !
NEGATIVE	Did not both going up Mount Srd .
NEGATIVE	Line was a mess , people without tickets pushed in front of people with tickets ( there was a ticket booth at the front of the queue and you ’ re supposed to go to the back of the line after buying tickets but staff didn ’ t have any care factor so it was chaos ) .
NEGATIVE	The facility is built on the wrong side of the cable car so views are obscured by the wires .
NEGATIVE	Best view was half way down the mountain which was saw from a taxi ( we couldn ’ t bear to get in the queue again after the first experience ) .
NEGATIVE	Staff also let their mates queue jump .
NEGATIVE	It is only useful to reach the point for starting buggy adventure ( TO DO ! ! )
NEGATIVE	A round trip for 150 kuna is very very too much for this thing .
NEGATIVE	The cable cars are overcrowded and due to the people is even difficult to see the panorama .
NEGATIVE	I think it is not indispensable .
NEGATIVE	Very expensive for what you get really , I was a bit disappointed really .
NEGATIVE	Had to be done .
NEGATIVE	Restaurant at top has splendid views but is priciy
NEGATIVE	Cable car was very full many people could not see out .
NEGATIVE	Did not see anything we did not see on the buggy outing we took .
NEGATIVE	Up and down I. Half hour .
NEGATIVE	Queuing 45 in the heat .
NEGATIVE	Nice spot to have lunch but would not rave .
NEGATIVE	I walked up and took the cable car down , walking was much better , the views on way up are spectacular .
NEGATIVE	It 's cheaper and you 'd probably see more .
NEGATIVE	Really expensive for what is a very quick ride in a packed cable car , could not see a thing !
NEGATIVE	If you can not walk up then I suggest you get a taxi up ! !
NEGATIVE	Nice view from the top station but not worth 530 hkr for a family of five . 120 for adults and 50 for kids up to 12 year .
NEGATIVE	We did not visit the retaurant but it has a great view over the city .
NEGATIVE	The cable cars are a bit pricey for what you get at 20 Euros - the same price you pay to walk the city walls .
NEGATIVE	If you only have a short time in Dubrovnik I would skip the cable cars up to Mount Srd .
NEGATIVE	Your time would be better spent walking the city walls and exploring the side streets in old town .
NEGATIVE	It is mildly interesting but it looks like it was put together by a high school club with zero budget .
NEGATIVE	Who would spend all that time and money to build a tram up a mountain and only have it accommodate two cars ?
NEGATIVE	And there are only two cable cars , resulting in long lines .
NEGATIVE	There is a museum at the top which is a ( one-sided ) look at the war .
NEGATIVE	The best views are from on top of the museum , which is some old fort or war bunker or something .
NEGATIVE	The war was in the 90 's and yet the best photography and video clips looks like they are from the 1950 's .
NEGATIVE	I have seen better video from WWII .
NEGATIVE	Would recommend cable car up and walk down or if you are up for it walk up and down .
NEGATIVE	Fabulous view from the top but extremely over priced .
NEGATIVE	My friend and I tried the cable car while holidaying in Dubrovnik and found it to be the most disappointing of the activities we did there .
NEGATIVE	You get better views for free from the lookout spot near the city .
NEGATIVE	You got a decent view of Dubrovnik Old Town from directly above BUT the planning of the structure is very poor , you can only get a picture of the city without the cable car steel cable in it from one spot .
NEGATIVE	Frankly I would not bother .
NEGATIVE	It 's popular with tour groups , not cheap , and you get to the top with little to do other than stand in a queue to go back down .
NEGATIVE	I can see the appeal of this for those that may struggle to walk around Dubrovnik , but of all the amazing things we did on our trip this ranked very much last .
NEGATIVE	We did walk to the abandoned fort about 25 min down the road ( there are no signs , we did this based on another traveller ) and that made it sort of interesting but its clear that 's not the path most follow .
NEGATIVE	So many cool things to do in the area that are active ( e.g. kayaking , Lokrum , beaches ) - I would skip this .
NEGATIVE	The ride is crammed with people and there is not much to do once you reach the top of the ride .
NEGATIVE	That 's it .
NEGATIVE	You get a nice view over the old town , but if you walk up the small streets above the old town , you can catch allmost the same view for free .
NEGATIVE	We did not think it was worth the money and honestly the trip was a bit boring .
NEGATIVE	A taxi may be more viable if there are a few of you
NEGATIVE	We were told that we had to do the cable car while we were in Dubrovnik .
NEGATIVE	Not cheap and prone to shut if there is any wind .
NEGATIVE	He wanted to charge us 45Euro , which would be less than the cable car tickets for 4 of us but more than the standard taxi rate of about 180kuna ( $30 ) , so we went to the Ploce gate , grabbed a taxi and rode to the top .
NEGATIVE	The tour groups made the line to go back down very long but they have a separate line for non-tour groups , which they did not tell us about until we were nearly at the front of the line after waiting for 30 minutes .
NEGATIVE	The views are amazing and the bar / cafe / restaurant at the top is surprisingly reasonable ( $4 cappuccino , $7 beer , $10 cocktails ) given the amazing view .
NEGATIVE	One of the taxi drivers approached us with a great idea to take a taxi to the top and ride the cable car back down with a one way ticket .
NEGATIVE	We went first thing in the morning when they opened at 9am and there was already a massive line , probably an hour wait at least .
NEGATIVE	We walked around the fort but did not go in the museum due to time constraints .
NEGATIVE	Overall , it will take much less time and is less money if you have a couple people to split the taxi cost with .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride down only lasts about 5 minutes and if you are not in the front of the car you don ’ t have a good view of Old Town anyway , so my recommendation would be to take the taxi up AND back , get a drink at the restaurant and see the War museum / memorial if you have time .
NEGATIVE	If you have already rode in a cable car before it ’ s not a big deal and you really are only going up there for the view anyway .
NEGATIVE	On the way up have them stop at the viewing point along the road for pictures .
NEGATIVE	The view is definitely worth it though , I would say that is a must do but the cable car can be skipped .
NEGATIVE	Goes to the top of a hill so you can get a good view of the Old City .
NEGATIVE	Nothing up there but an expensive cafe restaurant .
NEGATIVE	Trip take 4 mins up , 4 mins back and cost you a tenner .
NEGATIVE	Do not go , waste of a tenner .
NEGATIVE	We spent 2 hours at the top relaxing and drinking coffee .
NEGATIVE	The views are spectacular . it was well worth the visit .
NEGATIVE	Everything else up there is also pricey !
NEGATIVE	If you have sneakers with , take your sweet time and climb up .
NEGATIVE	Dont think its worth the money .
NEGATIVE	Too expensive for a 2 min ride also some guy wanted to go with his dog and he was not allowed , i kind of understood it but still they could let him pass thru .
NEGATIVE	When we did finally managed to catch it working it was expensive and there is not much to do at the top , short of a restaurant ( expensive ) viewing platform ( good for photos ) and an exhibition on the 1991 seige , which again had a cost ( this really should be included in the ticket price ! ) .
NEGATIVE	It was over 90 degrees in the town and not a breeze , but we were told that it was too windy to opperate the cable car and that they could not say when the situation would change .
NEGATIVE	Having been up cable cars in Austria and Switzerland and Italy to similar specifications I suspect it may have been more like - we can not be bothered .
NEGATIVE	We tried to get on the cable car 3 times in the first two days of our holiday .
NEGATIVE	Overall we were glad we did it for the photo opps , but we certainly would not do it again , and if we had known how little there was to do at the top , we would not have paid for a return trip , as we were thinking of going down again about 30 mins later .
NEGATIVE	Although the view from the top of the mountain is breath-taking , the cable car rode was quite unsatisfactory .
NEGATIVE	It took a long time to get on the car , as the capacity is only about 30 people .
NEGATIVE	The staff was a bit taciturn as well .
NEGATIVE	There were very long lines .
NEGATIVE	I guess it must have been the heat .
NEGATIVE	However I have better pictures from the city walls and there is not much to do once you are up there .
NEGATIVE	A really expensive ride up and back
NEGATIVE	Do not get me wrong , the facility is nice and the view is gorgeous .
NEGATIVE	The views are what you would expect but it is difficult to get panoramic views due to the cable car and viewpoint positioning .
NEGATIVE	A totally forgettable experience .
NEGATIVE	You get herded on for the trip up and down .
NEGATIVE	Save your time , money and patience .
NEGATIVE	Personally , this was the low point of what has otherwise been a fantastic visit to one of the world 's premier cities .
NEGATIVE	The terrace bar was completely dismissive - forget trying to get a drink !
NEGATIVE	Once you manage to get on the cable car & reach the top of the hill you get amazing view , however , we feel the price of ride is a rip off .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride up to the fort overlooking Dubrovnik boasts great views but lasts only a couple of minutes and costs 100kn each . an alternative for those able is to walk up via the well marked zig zag path .
NEGATIVE	Queuing system means that it is difficult to purchase your ticket from the nearby booth , until you are at the actual barrier - not ideal if the queue is moving at the time .
NEGATIVE	Meant to be one of the key excursions to do when visiting the old town area of Dubrovnik - however I was fairly unimpressed with the whole experience .
NEGATIVE	There is a museum nearby which has lots of information exhibits from the 1990 's Civil War - fairly interesting features on the seige of Dubrovnik , although an additional fee not included in the cable car ticket price .
NEGATIVE	A fairy short cable car journey from the town to the top of hill in all honesty - all over in less than 3 minutes .
NEGATIVE	There is not very much to do at the top , apart from going to the restaurant or taking a short walk to the viewing platform .
NEGATIVE	No area at all for any shade from the sun , once you have left the cable car station - apart from the restaurant of course !
NEGATIVE	Great views of Dubrovnik , but nothing better than those from the City Walls
NEGATIVE	One irritation , is that cruise passengers take priority in the queue system .
NEGATIVE	Views from the cable car and from the top are spectacular but pricing is insane . 150 kunas per person for a 3 minutes roundtrip is not justifiable by any means .
NEGATIVE	Everything in Dubrovnik is overpriced and I won ’ t be going back .
NEGATIVE	I ’ m sure we would have had a more positive experience if they didn ’ t decide to shut the cable car ticket buying booth randomly in the middle of the day while we were queuing .
NEGATIVE	We ’ d read the mixed reviews on here about the cable car and decided to give it a shot .
NEGATIVE	We went to visit the museum after reaching the top and I ’ m glad we did as it made the long frustrating queue and short ride a bit more worth it .
NEGATIVE	The cable car ride is short as everyone has said , extremely hot and ( depending on who you ’ re travelling with ) smelly .
NEGATIVE	No one really knew what was going on and there wasn ’ t a proper organised queue so a lot of hot and grumpy people .
NEGATIVE	If you are inclined , probably worth a visit but if you ’ re pushed for time , you are not missing much .
NEGATIVE	This attraction is particularly poorly designed to cope with big crowds , which was evident when we visited on a day when several cruise ships were in port. We queued for 15 minutes to enter , which was not too bad , but we 'd have given it a total miss if we 'd known how much time we 'd spend queui...
NEGATIVE	Unbelievably , there are only 2 ladies toilet cubicles and 2 urinals and 1 cubicle in the gents .
NEGATIVE	When we decided to leave as it became very crowded , we discovered that the queue for getting out snaked dangerously up 2 flights of stairs , to cross the 2 queues for the toilets , the queue to get upstairs from the ground floor and the one blocking the restaurant door .
NEGATIVE	A staff member came out and informed us we 'd have to ' organise ourselves better , as we could not stand there ' .
NEGATIVE	All these queues converged in the one spot .
NEGATIVE	The view was magnificent but it certainly was not worth the money we paid , the lack of ' facilities ' , the poor design of the building , the lack of management and 75 minutes of queuing on dangerous stairs while people pushed and shoved their way around us .
NEGATIVE	I informed her that she or a manager of the premises would need to do that - we 'd paid for our tickets and that did not include taking on the job of organising a totally chaotic set of queues It took an unbelievable 45 minutes before we were back on the cable car going down - it appears that staff ...
NEGATIVE	When buying tickets , there is no signage or explanation of the option to buy a one way ticket and walk down , which we ended up doing when we discovered it as an option at the top AFTER we 'd already bought a return ticket on the cable car .
NEGATIVE	The views from the cable car platform at the top are just OK .
NEGATIVE	The ticket buying process and lack of separated lines ( for those buying tickets and those already with tickets ) is confusing .
NEGATIVE	You have to go at least part way down the hiking path in front of Fort Imperial to get really spectacular views over Dubrovnik uninterrupted by the cables .
NEGATIVE	Also there is a weird grade school key-on-a-stick system to use the toilet which is two flights of stairs below the entrance .
NEGATIVE	I was really looking forward to this , but I never made it through .
NEGATIVE	The queue was very long , slow moving and the sun beating down on us did not make me want to stand there .
NEGATIVE	Then the remaining members of the party showed up and immediately placed themselves in queue with their colleagues .
NEGATIVE	Quite rude to add 20-30 people in front of those who were already there .
NEGATIVE	It did not help that a tour group was in front of us , but apparently not all of them .
NEGATIVE	And I tried to show up when the cable cars started running .
NEGATIVE	I guess everyone else did too .
NEGATIVE	I left in frustration .
NEGATIVE	You would be way better off taking an uber to the top to enjoy the breath taking views
NEGATIVE	Unbelievable views but such a money grab .
NEGATIVE	Save yourself a mortgage payment and drive up .
NEGATIVE	You only get a view of half the city .
NEGATIVE	Not much on top except overpriced restaurant and gift shop .
NEGATIVE	Disappointing .
NEGATIVE	Turns out you can drive your own car to the top for free .
NEGATIVE	If you don ’ t have a car , might be worth it for the beautiful views from te top .
NEGATIVE	We barely had the chance to take some photos ! ! ! ! !
NEGATIVE	15 € per person for what ? ?
NEGATIVE	For like 3 minutes ? ?
NEGATIVE	We suggest to go by car on the hill as there is a road that goes up and you will get many beautiful photos as well as you will have your own time and then you can spend the 15 € for a nice coffe in the cafe-restaurant on the hill with the most amazing view of old town and rest of Dubrovnik ! ! !
NEGATIVE	The cable car is a fast 2 minute ride up and don ’ t expect to see much unless you ’ re one of the first 4 people on and can rush to the best view point before everyone packs in .
NEGATIVE	There ’ s an expensive restaurant at the top but some nice views outside .
NEGATIVE	It was quite windy up top so take a jumper even if the weather is warm down the hill .
NEGATIVE	It ’ s really rocky , so wear good shoes , although we coped in sandals and thongs .
NEGATIVE	The best part was walking down .
NEGATIVE	We were on our own for the 2km trip .
POSITIVE	Amazing views of the old city & out over the sea from the top .
POSITIVE	Price for return on cable Car was 120 kuna each ?
POSITIVE	This gave a fascinating history of the defence of Dubrovnik by a small group of locals in the 1990s .
POSITIVE	We visited the Napolionic fort at the top of the hill overlooking the old town of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Just around the corner from the museum is the cable car .
POSITIVE	It also gave us the best view of the old town too .
POSITIVE	We found that it would cost 170 kuna each , which included entrance into the museum but we worked out that an Uber up , entrance to the museum and a cable car ride down worked out cheaper . 30K Uber . 4 x museum tickets 120K , 4 x tickets on the cable car 120K .
POSITIVE	The cable car at 94Kuna each is not cheap but the views , as many have said , are fantastic .
POSITIVE	Try to go up either late or early in the day before the cruise ships & tour buses go .
POSITIVE	The cable car , at the top , has a restaurant but I believe it is expensive .
POSITIVE	We spent around 1.5 hours just admiring the wonderful view .
POSITIVE	We went up at 4:30 pm , & it was not that crowded as the tour groups had already left .
POSITIVE	We only went from top to bottom .
POSITIVE	The views were fantastic .
POSITIVE	The pound as I write this = 8K .
POSITIVE	It was short journey but definitely view is great . ( panoramic ) .
POSITIVE	The ride each way only takes a few minutes but unless you can hike up very steep mountains , take the cable car .
POSITIVE	The food in the restaurant was also very good so this was an ideal trip to while away a few of hours .
POSITIVE	The ride down is smooth and a lot easier than walking down which you can do along a very zig zaggy path .
POSITIVE	Some of my friends said that its expensive but all i can say is the view is amazing .
POSITIVE	Weather was nice and so surprisingly there was not a lot of people .
POSITIVE	The vista includes the Island of Lokrum , the Old Town of Dubrovnik , Lapad & Babin Kuk , Gruz Harbour and all the way over the Elfati Islands .
POSITIVE	The cable car is worth every penny for the amazing views from the top of Mount Srd .
POSITIVE	The views from there are fantastic though and free .
POSITIVE	Stunning !
POSITIVE	Such a great view from the top of this cable car ride it has to be done if you are in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Smooth ride and easy to use .
POSITIVE	Gift shop and restaurant at the top as well .
POSITIVE	A must do as the most amazing views .
POSITIVE	Stunning !
POSITIVE	A few tips , check out the arrival of cruise ships before you go there are several sites that will tell you this information and if it busy always go later in the afternoon when it ’ s quieter , buy the war museum entry ticket with your cable car ticket , lovely restaurant nice food at the top think...
POSITIVE	Such a good vantage point for photos , and very good Homeland War exhibition at the fort .
POSITIVE	Highly recommended
POSITIVE	Visit the Srdj - where the Croatians held out against the Serbian onslaught and kept Dubrovnik free of occupation .
POSITIVE	If there is a queue and you haven ’ t bought your ticket go to the right hand side of the queue as the ticket office is there and rejoin the queue .
POSITIVE	See the old city , the outer city , the many islands and a beautiful Adriatic sea .
POSITIVE	Not a scary cable car ride if you are not keen on heights .
POSITIVE	Outstanding views and a lot of history shown .
POSITIVE	Although I was told there was room , I said the car was too crowded and was allowed to wait for the next one .
POSITIVE	Make sure you do not get into a crowded car as there is little scope to move around it if it is packed .
POSITIVE	You get a great panoramic view from the top of the mountain after enjoying the ride up .
POSITIVE	Many people were walking both up and down , but down definitely seemed the way to go to me .
POSITIVE	You will overlook entire Dubrovnic and the Adriatic sea to the horizon .
POSITIVE	If the weather is clear , take a trip .
POSITIVE	Well worth a trip up .
POSITIVE	A bit expencive , but wort while .
POSITIVE	A must if you like wonderful views .
POSITIVE	We went up on a clear day about 1pm the views of the old city are spectacular also the panoramic views are amazing .
POSITIVE	Both me and my husband are nervous of heights so the short ride was just enough for us .
POSITIVE	Wow .... really loved this ride .
POSITIVE	A lot of people waiting in line , but well worth the wait !
POSITIVE	Once at the top , walk all around to fully appreciate the views .
POSITIVE	We went at lunch time so this could be avoided .
POSITIVE	If you have time , relax over drinks and lunch at the outdoor restaurant .
POSITIVE	Our cruise ship came into Dubrovnik , and after walking around this beautiful city , we decided to take the cable car ride up for the breathing panoramic views .
POSITIVE	There is a small museum giving an account of the history of the cable car and a missable gift shop .
POSITIVE	When we got to to top we had lunch over looking all those beautiful views in the open restaurant .
POSITIVE	Prices reasonable and service brilliant even though they were very busy .
POSITIVE	A small queue to be seated but well worth it .
POSITIVE	The views were stunning .
POSITIVE	To get to the height that it takes you and to see the old town and the view of Lokrum Island is unreal .
POSITIVE	The view is so impressive just as it is !
POSITIVE	There is a hugh cross just to the left of the restaurant which makes for another beautiful photo .
POSITIVE	WiFi is available and we saw several people emailing their photos from their cellphones .
POSITIVE	Everywhere you look , is a beautiful photographic vista .
POSITIVE	A real must if visiting Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	We did not bring our binoculars , but we were not disappointed .
POSITIVE	Let this be part of your Dubrovnik bucket list .
POSITIVE	Going for sunset provides a hell of a view .
POSITIVE	The view is beautiful , and it 's great to see the city from above .
POSITIVE	I think the cable car is worth doing .
POSITIVE	When I went there was no line , and the cars went up and down frequently .
POSITIVE	It is a bit difficult to find the station in hilly Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The views are great and the machine is safely built in Germany .
POSITIVE	No need to queue if you take the cable car later in the day when the cruise passengers are gone .
POSITIVE	I did not eat at the restaurant , just went up , walked around at the top for a bit , and went back down .
POSITIVE	You can get the tickets in several places in town .
POSITIVE	This is one of the must things to do in Dubrovnik !
POSITIVE	About an hour was enough .
POSITIVE	You get an entirely new perspective to the red rooftops of the city from up here !
POSITIVE	It is less than four minutes but provides the best views anywhere .
POSITIVE	Not much else than stunning views at the top ( if you are not into war museums ) , so you can probably take the next car down .
POSITIVE	We went in the morning and I am sure it would be much busier later on in the day .
POSITIVE	Most pleasant maybe to plan lunch up there in one of the cafes
POSITIVE	Lovely views from the top , well worth the visit .
POSITIVE	Cars are not jam packed , plenty of room to move while travelling up and down .
POSITIVE	Pricey if you want a drink so take a bottle of water with you . £3 to go round the castle / museum worth it .
POSITIVE	Certainly worth the £20 ticket the views once you get to the top are fantastic .
POSITIVE	You find out a lot about the Croats fight for independence .
POSITIVE	Relatively new cable car effortlessly gets you to the top of Srd hill for a fantastic view of Dubrovnik Old Town .
POSITIVE	Good to do around dusk to have the chance of seeing a gorgeous sunset .
POSITIVE	Camera is a must .
POSITIVE	When up there stay until sunset to catch some beautiful night pictures of Dubrovnik by night !
POSITIVE	Stunning view , try to go at the end of the day to enjoy the sunset on the awesome terrasse .
POSITIVE	You should buy your ticket before from the net to avoid the queue .
POSITIVE	When in Dobrovnik you must take the gondola and go up the hill ! ! !
POSITIVE	Excellent site to visit and enjoy the view of this superb city by the sea .
POSITIVE	Definately worth a visit specially in the summer to escape the tourist hustle and bustle around the old town .
POSITIVE	You can go for a walk at the top or to the restaurant over looking Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	It was such fun going up the cable car and the views were amazing .
POSITIVE	Spectacular view and ride .
POSITIVE	We loved it .
POSITIVE	Really nice restaurant and fabulous views make this a must .
POSITIVE	The story of the fort on Mt. Srd is very poignant .
POSITIVE	Worth a visit especially on a hot day as it is slightly cooler at the top .
POSITIVE	A great trip in the cable car which gave you excellent views of the city , good restaurant and the museum was excellent .
POSITIVE	Stunning views .
POSITIVE	A quick and steep cable car journey takes you high above the city .
POSITIVE	The views across the Adriatic and city are stunning .
POSITIVE	I took the cable car up for sunset and was not disappointed .
POSITIVE	Queues not too long .
POSITIVE	A must do trip if visiting Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	There is a resteraunt and bar at the top .
POSITIVE	Please be aware at peak season this is the busiest time to use the cable car so you may have to wait .
POSITIVE	You can travel round trip for 120kn .
POSITIVE	The views are amazing .
POSITIVE	Good way to see all of the walled city from above .
POSITIVE	If you are visiting Dubrovnik you must try the cable car view from top is amazing there are cafes there you can sit for sometime and take photos
POSITIVE	The best bit aside from the view ( marred a little by the cable car pillars ) , is the cafe bar , where you will be served reasonably priced delicious cocktails , by lovely waiters .
POSITIVE	the cable car is just outside the city walls and is worth going up to get the pictures of the old town . we went up about 10 am and it was busy , we noticed it was busy up to 12 oclock then eased off
POSITIVE	There are various viewing spots at the top and a restaurant .
POSITIVE	I waited 15 mins to come down .
POSITIVE	It was not to bad !
POSITIVE	Another must do .
POSITIVE	The sightseeing from the city is wonderful ! !
POSITIVE	A quick ride up to the top but what a view .
POSITIVE	When it gets a little cold , it 's great to snuggle under the red blankets and the patio heaters !
POSITIVE	It was too hot to walk the walls so this was a better option .
POSITIVE	Such an awesome experience ! !
POSITIVE	The cable car up Mount Srd is a must-do for anyone in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	There are line-ups so plan your time .
POSITIVE	Bliss .
POSITIVE	It is a smooth cable car ride because this is not a place of particularly strong winds .
POSITIVE	In April there were lower temperatures than we wanted and a bit of a breeze so the Panorama Restaurant provided a blanket and a heater that buffered the temp and the breeze .
POSITIVE	Words can not explain how awesome the view is !
POSITIVE	Make sure you save enough time for the superior restaurant and lots of photos .
POSITIVE	Really worth it
POSITIVE	It probably would not be worth doing without ok weather as the whole point is being able to look down and take in the Old Town in the surrounding context .
POSITIVE	Well dressed , courteous staff offered a splendid menu but we had not allotted time so just enjoyed the view and the Croatian beer .
POSITIVE	Totally recommend to go for the sunset ... Try to be one of the first ones to go inside the cabin and pic the front corner ... there is the better view .
POSITIVE	The cable car itself is really not all that special but the views from the top are .
POSITIVE	The cable car gives a couple of minutes ride up the hill overlooking Dubrovnik and the Adriatic Sea .
POSITIVE	They are nice starting points but they do not offer much that the surrounding Mount Srd area dosesn't offer .
POSITIVE	The views the other way - towards Bosnia - are not especially attractive across a surprisingly barren environment without much fauna at all .
POSITIVE	We SHOULD have gone to the Fort that defended Dubrovnik but ALL the things we missed will lead us back to this lovely adventure spot .
POSITIVE	We could also have gone on the dune buggy rides but did not .
POSITIVE	There are two observation decks at the higher station .
POSITIVE	There are two other features at the top of Srd - a huge cross that serves as a memorial and a Napoleonic fort that saw serious action in the " Homeland War " .
POSITIVE	The approach to the fort is amusing with a little danger sign extolling the risks of heading that way but the fort itself is very moving even if the Napoleonic and Habsburg history has been glossed over somewhat and what remains of the ruined fortress contains a museum celebrating the defence of Dub...
POSITIVE	The outside restaurant has amazing views - worth going there for eating / drinking in such an amazing location rather than for the quality of the food .
POSITIVE	If a traveller had a choice between walls or cable car , they should forget the walls because the much better view is from the top .
POSITIVE	The trip in the cable car is quite relaxing and a great experience - go for it !
POSITIVE	The views are fantastic and the food and service is great .
POSITIVE	Visit the Museum and take in lunch or dinner .
POSITIVE	there r always someone in charge inside the cable car , that makes you feel more comfortable and safe : ) even someone like me who feels dizzy in higher altitudes : ) but everything worths to see the view !
POSITIVE	This city was shelled for more than five months in the 90s and a view from the top of the mountain gives some idea of what the people suffered .
POSITIVE	A spectacular way to really get an idea of the old city and it 's huge , thick walls .
POSITIVE	Be prepared to queue and wait for quite a while to be able to access the mountain top .
POSITIVE	I like this cable car because you have very beautiful view during your trip to the Srd mountain and it is not expensive at all
POSITIVE	This part of the country highlights its role in the siege of 1991-2 whilst the rest of Croatia seems not to want to acknowledge that it occured .
POSITIVE	The trip up to the top of Mt Srd takes about 3 minutes and the views are stunning on the way up .
POSITIVE	Once at the top you can explore the trails and look down on the city from 400metres above .
POSITIVE	Take your camera for a unique view of this small segregated part of Croatia .
POSITIVE	You have to see the amazing views of Dubrovnik from the top .
POSITIVE	Pick a clear day to get the most out of this .
POSITIVE	Excellent experience from bottom to top - from which the views are to die for .
POSITIVE	The fort which helped the defenders of Dubrovnik is now a museum which tells the story of this defence .
POSITIVE	Visitor centre at the top has clean toilets .
POSITIVE	Must do if you are there .
POSITIVE	My wife and I went up in the cable car twice on our trip to Dubrovnik , we went up in the evening as the sun was setting and enjoyed a fantastic meal in the restaurant with the best views ( reserve a table on the edge to get the best views as the restaurant gets very busy ) we then decided to return...
POSITIVE	Getting to the Cable Car Station is a bit of a climb , but if you do not like steps it is on a main road so with a map you could avoid those steps .
POSITIVE	Found the Cable Car on the very first afternoon , when the sun was shining .
POSITIVE	Flight time is only about 3 minutes , and not even worth taking photos as you go , wait till the top where you will be very rewarded .
POSITIVE	Did not try the restaurant though .
POSITIVE	Wow .
POSITIVE	At the top , facilities were geared to the shop and restaurant , but we did ' break out ' and walk around outside .
POSITIVE	Down to the memorial cross and around on the hill .
POSITIVE	Outside the walls by the Ploce Gate is a station for a high speed cable car gondola that takes you up to the top of Srd Hill ( serge ) which offers incredible views of the old city and the surrounding area .
POSITIVE	A MUST DO
POSITIVE	We were in Dubrovnik as a port stop on our cruise .
POSITIVE	This is one trip you must not miss. The cafe at the top is wonderful with the most amazing views .
POSITIVE	The cable car station at the top is 1,324 feet above sea level and it only takes 4 minutes to go up from the station below .
POSITIVE	If you organised yourself I am sure you could enjoy several hours along the ridge - maybe even walk down .
POSITIVE	It is so quiet and you can have a walk around and be totally on your own .
POSITIVE	We were walking around the old city walls .
POSITIVE	They would not accept Euros , only Kunas and / or charge cards .
POSITIVE	We also visited the fort and it was so interesting and very emotive seeing the history and the destruction of Dubrovnik during the war which ultimately broke up the old Yugoslavia , it shows how the old town was badly damaged and how amazing the restoration has been .
POSITIVE	This was our favourite trip and can be reached by car as well as on the cable car which has only been re-established in the last few years .
POSITIVE	We had the best lunch enjoying the scenery and the wild flowers in complete peace and quiet .
POSITIVE	There is an old fort there that now has a display showing pictures of the recent war in Croatia .
POSITIVE	At the top are viewing stations , a restaurant , toilets , and a souvenir stand .
POSITIVE	The cost was 80 Croatian Kuna per adult ( about $15 ) .
POSITIVE	At night the top of Mount Srd is illuminated and can be seen from the old town .
POSITIVE	There are goats grazing on the mounting which we saw on the descent .
POSITIVE	You can also visit Mount Srd by car .
POSITIVE	A 5 minute walk up the hill outside the city walls from Pile Gate , we visited on a Sunday morning around 11am .
POSITIVE	You will have great views to the old town , better to go in the morning or late afternoon to enjoy it ( Not too much hot sun ) .
POSITIVE	We highly recommend learning about the history from a local to fully appreciate the strategic location of Dubrovnik and the mountain .
POSITIVE	The view was spectacular as was the lunch overlooking Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	We timed it perfectly as there were only a few people ahead of us waiting in line .
POSITIVE	On a whim we jumped on the cable car and made our way to the top .
POSITIVE	Contrary to another reviewers opinion we were told by staff that the cable car goes every 15 minutes no matter how few are on it , there were only 10 or so when we were going up and around the same going back down and as we passed the other cable car there were only 4 people in it !
POSITIVE	I had never been on a cable car so I was determined to visit this Fantastic views from above , the gift shop was not expensive either .
POSITIVE	Smooth journey though yes it doesn ` t last long but it was worth it for views .
POSITIVE	Visited the Museum of the Homeland War in the old fort behind the cable car , around €10 for 2 adults , kids were free - a lot of the info is in Croatian but watching the footage that runs on the tv screens on a loop is a must - images of the fear and anguish on old ladies faces as they watched the ...
POSITIVE	The view from the top is fantastic .
POSITIVE	Especially at sunset .
POSITIVE	The cable car is extremely efficient and runs continuously with almost no waiting time .
POSITIVE	We did not visit the exhibition at the top which we regret .
POSITIVE	Easy to reach from the old town .
POSITIVE	What a great experience !
POSITIVE	We went up at sunset and got great views of Dubrovnik and of the setting sun and the rising moon !
POSITIVE	Nice smooth ride up the hill , with breathtaking views from the top , we did it towards sunset for best views and pictures . restaurant on top seems very busy , we just had drinks , but looked like a very nice place to eat .
POSITIVE	For the best view leave the viewing platforms and walk past the restaurant to the rocks beyond .
POSITIVE	Service was very efficient with very little delay .
POSITIVE	Essential to do whilst in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Went here wirh my family , the cake cars are modern and hold about ten people . i felt very safe in them .
POSITIVE	Drinks are expensive at the bar so take your own .
POSITIVE	at 300 Kuna ( $60 CAD ) is very much worth taking few hours of your day to jump on the cable car and go on top of the mountain .
POSITIVE	The views are amazing . we went fir cocktails at the top , they were amazing , was si chilled out , we did not want to go back to earth .
POSITIVE	Recommend .
POSITIVE	The view of the city and the sea is breathtaking .
POSITIVE	Plan your visit as the long lines or bad weather could affect your trip .
POSITIVE	The Panorama restaurant on the top offers great food at a great price .
POSITIVE	We waited for the lines go decrease and then the wind acted up and the cable car was shut down .
POSITIVE	Definitely worth a visit the views are stunning .
POSITIVE	Before heading out from your hotel , you may want to call to see if it is running .
POSITIVE	You can save some time and buy your ticket on line .
POSITIVE	We wasted time and money taking a cab there .
POSITIVE	A friend recommended this attraction .
POSITIVE	Once you get there there is a lovely restaurant for drinks or eating with panoramic views .
POSITIVE	We went for lunch on the outdoor one .
POSITIVE	The cabin car is a short journey to the top with plenty of room .
POSITIVE	Make sure the cable car is on your list of things to do while in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	They have an indoor and an outdoor restaurants .
POSITIVE	It is a must , just beautiful views .
POSITIVE	There is a wait to have a table but it was worth it .
POSITIVE	Only in town for a few days ?
POSITIVE	We ended up taking a taxi .
POSITIVE	It was so worth it .
POSITIVE	We initially thought it was going a quick 30 minute trip up to look around , take some pictures and come back down , but ended up staying up there for 2 hours .
POSITIVE	cost around 100kunas to get aup on the hill and see the most beautiful wiev in dubrovnik . . shame to miss it while you are around ! !
POSITIVE	The fort has interesting history going back to Napoleon and was used extensively by Croatians during the 1991-1995 war .
POSITIVE	The view is nothing short of incredible with a 360 view of the old town , surrounding city and the near by mountains .
POSITIVE	The food is excellent and the prices are average .
POSITIVE	If you walk along the gravel path outside the cable car it will lead you to the gate .
POSITIVE	It 's now a museum and worth checking out .
POSITIVE	Do not miss Fort Imperial next to the cable car .
POSITIVE	You can reserve so you do not wait in line .
POSITIVE	TIP : Avoid some of the wait time by purchasing your ticket at the store outside the Buza Gate and not at the booth where you get on the cable car .
POSITIVE	Go up top and see a view of the old town rivals the views from the cable car viewing platform .
POSITIVE	The cost of entrance is not included w / the cable car ticket ( I think it was 30 kuna / person ) .
POSITIVE	You can also buy tickets for the bus to the airport .
POSITIVE	The ride is short but worth the money for me .
POSITIVE	Amazing views !
POSITIVE	I would not be able to walk it .
POSITIVE	I went up around 7pm so as the sun was setting . . you can pre book dinner up there or you can just drop in for a cocktail / drink !
POSITIVE	Cost is 150 kuna or 20 euros and the drinks are similar prices to the old town .
POSITIVE	Same price , just less wait .
POSITIVE	Too steep , too far .
POSITIVE	Worth a visit !
POSITIVE	We did not have to wait that long but when cruise ships are in the queues can be long and the time can prove frustrating , but the views at the top are absolutely amazing , it gives you the other view of the wall city of Dubrovnik ..... having walked the walls earlier it was great to get the aerial ...
POSITIVE	I did this on the first day of my visit .
POSITIVE	The . gentle switch back trail is enjoyable but need to figure out the way back your destination at the trails end .
POSITIVE	The cable car is a quick journey over in a couple of minutes but the views at the top are amazing .
POSITIVE	The views of the walled city from the top are magnficent !
POSITIVE	Easiest way to visit Museum atop Ny Srd .
POSITIVE	Purchase a one way ticket if you would enjoy the walk down .
POSITIVE	The restaurant at the top has the most amazing view .
POSITIVE	Amazing views looking down on the walled city .
POSITIVE	But you will eat out at cheaper in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Switch off your mobile or roaming as you switch mobile carrier to Bosnia at the top of the cable car .
POSITIVE	The locals tell you the restaurant is good but its not badly priced but worth it .
POSITIVE	If you are going as a couple its a class date location .
POSITIVE	The restaurant there was also well worthwhile and worth trying for drinks and views at the very least .
POSITIVE	It really gives you perfect perspective on the town below and soooo much more .
POSITIVE	It 's the cable car experience in Dubrovnik that made me think of Dubrovnik as th3 Cape Town of Europe .
POSITIVE	I particularly enjoyed walking out on the hills beyond the war museum .
POSITIVE	All in all 100 % recommended
POSITIVE	We recently took the cable car and sat at the top to enjoy the view and relax - it was well worth the time .
POSITIVE	A picture perfect postcard view .
POSITIVE	Probably the best way to view dubrovnik old town , reasonably priced and well worth a visit .
POSITIVE	The view was stunning and to see the city from above was amazing .
POSITIVE	This is a must when in Dubrovnik ! ! !
POSITIVE	It is well worth it .
POSITIVE	It was really nice to see the views from the top of Mount Srd .
POSITIVE	We went up on a Sunday afternoon and Nadia a very short wait .
POSITIVE	The round trip ticket costs 120 kuna ( about $20.00 ) .
POSITIVE	Tried to drive up in my rental car a couple of nights ago but ran out of nerve !
POSITIVE	Take the cable car which is much easier on the nerves
POSITIVE	Fantastic photo ops .
POSITIVE	We really enjoyed the cable car , the views were unbelievable at the top and it was surprisingly very quick .
POSITIVE	There is a restaurant and bar at the top and also a museum which details the events of the war in the 90s which was very interesting .
POSITIVE	A must do when in Dubrovnik
POSITIVE	It 's a very short ride to the top but SO , SO worth while doing as the views below are stunning .
POSITIVE	The queues are long whether the cruise ships are in or not . . but they do move at a steady pace and we only waited about 20 minutes to go up .
POSITIVE	We walked past the War Musuem and up over and along the uneven ground further along and were rewarded with spectacular views up the coast line .
POSITIVE	We bought our tickets as we passed a place selling them en route . . no difference in price from at the cable car .
POSITIVE	In the glorious autumn sunshine it was not a big deal .
POSITIVE	If you go slightly later in the morning . . we were there around 10am ish . . the cruise tours will have gone down by the time you want to ... otherwise you might find yourself waiting a while to go back down . . many cruise tours seem to take their guests to the top and just come down in the cable ...
POSITIVE	Choosing the cable car ride was a decision that we were very happy with as it ’ s not only beautiful to see the city from above but the restaurant at the top is incredible with beautiful food and drink .
POSITIVE	The loos at the top were inadequate . . only 2 for ladies and they were always queues and they did not smell at all pleasant ... there are some at the bottom of the cable car .
POSITIVE	Decided to have lunch straight away and again very short time to wait for a table .
POSITIVE	Went up early afternoon , hardly any queue for the cabl car , very smooth ride up .
POSITIVE	The restaurants were busy so we headed down for some late food .
POSITIVE	Really worth while making the effort to walk these few hundred yards .
POSITIVE	We went up just before sunset to enjoy some beautiful colors .
POSITIVE	Lovely meal with amazing views .
POSITIVE	We had coffee and ice cream at the Panorama cafe by the cable car and I highly recommend doing that . . it 's not expensive and if you have made the effort to get to the top why not stay and enjoy it !
POSITIVE	This is definitely worth the ride even though it is not so spectacular in itself .
POSITIVE	Also consider the local restaurant about 1.5 South and walking down .
POSITIVE	Great experience would love to have been there for sunset .
POSITIVE	Joint ticket for the museum which was very good value .
POSITIVE	The view from the top of the cable car is a must see .
POSITIVE	Wonderful trip .
POSITIVE	Really good .
POSITIVE	The children loved it .
POSITIVE	There are a couple of little gift shops and a cafe where you can sit and eat with a panoramic view of one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
POSITIVE	There is also the modern war museum out the back which gives the account of the Serbian attack on Dubrovnik in 1991 .
POSITIVE	The view is fabulous but little else worth while to do up there .
POSITIVE	I had a glass of wine in the cafe while my husband went to the museum .
POSITIVE	Fantastic views .
POSITIVE	Would 100 % recommend .
POSITIVE	Well worth a look .
POSITIVE	Do not go around 11am though as you will meet all the cruise ship day passengers .
POSITIVE	Stunning views .
POSITIVE	We spent the morning of our wedding anniversary walking around at the top of the mountain after using the cable car . 120k per person return .
POSITIVE	Queue was long , go earlier or later .
POSITIVE	Just great ! !
POSITIVE	It was a gorgeous hot day when we were there but we still needed the little blankets that are on the chairs to cover up with as its a little chilly when you are so high .
POSITIVE	Once at the top there is a beautiful restaurant with the most fabulous views I have ever seen , nestled into the hillside .
POSITIVE	Buy your ticket at the little store at the exit from the Old City Buza gate to avoid standing in line at the gondola ( skip the line ) .
POSITIVE	Absolutely eat at the restaurant at the top and try to get a table right on the edge .
POSITIVE	Loved it .
POSITIVE	Very romantic , I can imagine there is been lots of proposals up there too !
POSITIVE	I could have sat there all day with my Aperol Spritz staring at the view .
POSITIVE	I am very scared of heights , but this ride was very smooth and quick .
POSITIVE	We took it up to the top for dinner and watched the sunset - completely worth it !
POSITIVE	No matter what you plan to do while in Dubrovnik you must include the cable car .
POSITIVE	The ride up and down in the cable car was simply stunning at sunset .
POSITIVE	Go early in the day to avoid the worst of the tour parties .
POSITIVE	The views are spectacular and the whole setup is well managed .
POSITIVE	I took the cable car for the views and the photograph opportunities and I was not disappointed .
POSITIVE	We thought it was high priced for the short journey 98kuna per person The restaurant at the top served good food at captive prices , but had wonderful views of the islands and the adriatic .
POSITIVE	Take time to walk around the hilltop which gives other views not visible from the cable-car terrace .
POSITIVE	The queues are long and it is hot standing about but it is worth every minute of it .
POSITIVE	Great opportunity to see some amazing views at the top !
POSITIVE	Spectacular views from the top in all directions .
POSITIVE	A must do whilst in Dubrovnik !
POSITIVE	If you are there the once it is a must .
POSITIVE	The queues to go up on our way back were ridiculous - so if you want to go for sunset go a bit earlier and wait up there .
POSITIVE	On a clear , fine day the views from the top are wonderful .
POSITIVE	Price is not that cheap but well worth it in our opinion !
POSITIVE	Cable cars only go once full .
POSITIVE	We went up at 5pm and came back down 6:45 pm .
POSITIVE	Excellent cafe and restaurant at the summit and shops .
POSITIVE	The old fort is worth a visit and museum depicting the 1992-5 war .
POSITIVE	The mountains on the one side and sea on the other .
POSITIVE	Ignoring advice from locals we travelled up to the top of the cable car ride mid-morning , but there did not seem to be the usual cruise ship-load of tourists , and we did not have to queue at all going up , walked straight into a car .
POSITIVE	However we had approximately 1 hour before the last cable car back down leaving us enough time to experience a wonderful sunset whilst enjoying a drink overlooking the wonderful city of Dubrovnik at night . .
POSITIVE	We were staying on the nearby island of Kolocep and took a sunset cruise from the hotel to Dubrovnik but were worried we had not allowed enough tine to take the cable car .
POSITIVE	The ride up was short and sweet , the car swaying slightly over a pylon support , and we walked out onto a multi level platform to admire the views .
POSITIVE	We walked around and then sat down in the restaurant to enjoy some refreshment .
POSITIVE	There is a shop but w managed to avoid that temptation .
POSITIVE	It was not unduly expensive , although the service was a bit slow because they clearly lost our order , but we had a good table at the edge with great views , so we were in no hurry .
POSITIVE	This is a trip you definitely should take , but make it nearer to lunchtime and then you can enjoy a meal with a great view
POSITIVE	Local advice is to go up in the evening to see the sunset but that did not fit in with our plans .
POSITIVE	Each car hold 30 passengers so queueing time is not too long .
POSITIVE	Tickets can be bought at the station or in a near by booth .
POSITIVE	Going down was similarly trouble free .
POSITIVE	The journey up takes about 5 mins but the views going up and from the top are spectacular .
POSITIVE	We took the cable car up in the mid-afternoon and had a drink and snack at the restaurant at the top on the terrace which was far from cheap but then the views were absolutely stunning , whilst the return fee of HRK 94 each ( £12 ) is a little steep for what is a three minute ride it is well worth i...
POSITIVE	There was a modest queue at the bottom to buy tickets and to go up , but as the cars cycle quickly this was no more than fifteen minutes , we forgot water but the shop over the road will sell you a half litre bottle for HRK 8 or a litre bottle for HRK 11 !
POSITIVE	Cost for a return journey is 130.00 kuna or you can be really adventurous and walk up / down .
POSITIVE	Great views of the old town and islands in the area .
POSITIVE	Several viewing areas and a restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	The views wow looking over the whole of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Looking at the old town from above is really something .
POSITIVE	You can see lockrum too
POSITIVE	Went up the cable car today and I have to say the views are amazing !
POSITIVE	You will get the best view of the entire Dubrovnik area by taking the cable car to the top of Mount Srd , and it 's the ideal place to watch the sun set over the Adriatic .
POSITIVE	Be sure while you are on the top of the mountain to visit the fortress , where you will see the shell holes from the Serb bombardment during the siege of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	It 's just beautiful !
POSITIVE	Well worth the trip
POSITIVE	It was hard to see the city that you just visited being destroyed for some unknown reason .
POSITIVE	It was also educational to watch the videos to see what was actually happening at the time .
POSITIVE	I also stopped in the museum they had for the Homeland War and found it very informative .
POSITIVE	Also be good hike up if you had the time and also save you the fee for the cable car !
POSITIVE	And if you have time , you can take the path back down the hill that has some monuments along the way .
POSITIVE	It makes you appreciate the beauty of the old city even more seeing what it looked like during the war .
POSITIVE	Worth a visit !
POSITIVE	This is an awesome attraction and the views you will get from the top of the mountain are absolutely breathtaking .
POSITIVE	The cable car lower station is a few minutes walk from the old city walls .
POSITIVE	It is also poignant that there are some real memories of the homeland war from the vantage point the Serbs held over Dubrovnic
POSITIVE	Have lunch at the top and be sure to visit the fortress to learn about the 90s Balkan war ( from a decidedly Croatian perspective ) .
POSITIVE	Looking north and west you can see a myriad of small islands and , in the evening , you can savour a spectacular sunset .
POSITIVE	The trip up takes less than 5 minutes but , when you come out of the top station , you are in a different world .
POSITIVE	Buy tickets in advance , 150 kuna for trip back and forth and they want cash .
POSITIVE	Was full on the way up but could still see well .
POSITIVE	Fast moving queue .
POSITIVE	It is worth every kuna to see the city and surrounding coastline from this perspective .
POSITIVE	Ride is worth it as view from top is exhilarating and unparalleled of this beautiful and authentic city !
POSITIVE	Always allow 30 to 45 minutes queue time if you have Panorama reservations or other plans .
POSITIVE	An early evening trip just before the sunset is highly recommended .
POSITIVE	Came back down with just one other couple and was able to take photos all around , amazing ! !
POSITIVE	Fell in love with DUBROVNIK !
POSITIVE	Nice and fast , no queues , great views .
POSITIVE	Only 30 words to go .
POSITIVE	Yay !
POSITIVE	Do not have to walk .
POSITIVE	Worth it .
POSITIVE	Do it .
POSITIVE	Yes .
POSITIVE	This was hands down one of the highlights of our trip to Croatia and Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Get there early and avoid weekends or you will have a wait .
POSITIVE	Whatever you choose , it 's time and money well spent !
POSITIVE	About £11 each but worth one trip for the views of the old town
POSITIVE	The price for the cable car had risen since I last checked the website a couple of months ago .
POSITIVE	At the top , relax and have a bite to eat at the restaurant , or walk through the war museum , or just marvel at the gorgeous sights .
POSITIVE	It 's a short 5 minute ride to the top on the cable car , all the while taking in panoramic views of Dubrovnik and Lokrum .
POSITIVE	Easy to find the cable car , it is close to the North city entrance ( Buza ) .
POSITIVE	We had walked outside of the walled city clockwise to get to the cable car location .
POSITIVE	It is now 150 Kunas roundtrip per person .
POSITIVE	About $23 per person .
POSITIVE	Your choice .
POSITIVE	Take the cable car from just outside the old city for 120 kuna and it takes you over the rooftops and up to the top for some truly spectacular if not the best views of Dubrovnik , you will not be dissapointed and whilst up there have a meal and or a drink at the Panorama restaurant , just superb , c...
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik is steep and it 's evident .
POSITIVE	Better to do that and come back into the Walled City through the Buza entrance & walk down the several flights of stairs instead of walking up the stairs to get to the cable car .
POSITIVE	You get the usual mix of folks w / selfie sticks and riders who do not share the view going up or down in the cable car .
POSITIVE	Always a must visit for us when visiting Dubrovnik , the views are spectacular sea view looking down on the old town and along the coast .
POSITIVE	Just think that this is the fastest & easiest way up to Mount Srd .
POSITIVE	One of the things I recommend is the cable car .
POSITIVE	Up there you can get a good view of the whole place : old and modern Dubrovnik , Lokrum island , with the Adriatic and distant Elafiti islands filling the horizon .
POSITIVE	Took us 3 visits before we could get on because of the long queues created by the many day visitors from the cruise ships arrivals .
POSITIVE	Recommend you have lunch in the Panorama restaurant , food is very good .
POSITIVE	Best to go there by sunset .
POSITIVE	It takes you up to Mt Srd .
POSITIVE	Well worth a trip on this cable just to get views of the city , it ’ s so beautiful .
POSITIVE	Great experience to help get your bearings on where things are located and to look down on the old town .
POSITIVE	There is also a restaurant and a snack bar .
POSITIVE	Not to be missed !
POSITIVE	There is a fee to pay to get on the cable car , there is a shop and restaurant at the top .
POSITIVE	Modern facilities at the top , with viewing platforms and a nice bar / restaurant to sit and admire the gorgeous view .
POSITIVE	The Old Fort Museum at the top tells the story of the 1991 attacks on Dubrovnik and is worth visiting .
POSITIVE	An excellent way to view the old city without climbing all the steps .
POSITIVE	This was the highlight of our trip to Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Seafarers in all their guises passed before us and we could have spent the day there , but other attractions beckoned !
POSITIVE	It is not well signed when you exit the cable car building , but as you go out of the back door , turn left , it is a short walk to the fort .
POSITIVE	Our tour rep. lunched at the restaurant and was very happy with the food / service .
POSITIVE	No doubt when in Dubrovnik you will walk around the Old Town and take in the various sites and sounds .
POSITIVE	I was unable to walk the old city walls and was glad in a way , as the views from the mountain surpassed those available from the walls for less effort and fewer crowds .
POSITIVE	We had coffee in the cliffside cafe ` , as usual the coffee was cold , but the waiter was really charming and brought some hot milk .
POSITIVE	It is a bit cold and gloomy in there with water dripping in places but it is well worth a visit .
POSITIVE	The panoramic views of the islands and the mountains are spectacular .
POSITIVE	You can buy a joint ticket with the cable car ticket .
POSITIVE	Also do not miss the Museum about the Croatian War of Independence in the fort at the top .
POSITIVE	If walking is not problem to you , forget the overprised cablecar !
POSITIVE	With an average of 2,ooo passengers disembarking to sightsee you can imagine how crowded the walls become !
POSITIVE	We went for sunset , but be careful leave yourself time as the ques can take as long as 1 hour as you get close to the sunset .
POSITIVE	On the up , there are better views when you go other side the museum from cablecar station .
POSITIVE	Over looking the Old Town and the surrounding area you just look in amazement of the beauty of the town and coastline .
POSITIVE	I am not good with heights , but the car takes about 3 mins . to reach the top and by facing the mountain on both trips ( sad but necessary ) I had no problems and was rewarded by the views on arrival .
POSITIVE	There goes rocky path to up and you can enjoy beatiful views at same time when you going up , I think you can take also much better photos example from old town on the way .
POSITIVE	The city walls require a lot of physical effort , lots ( and lots ) of steps and most of the time we were in the old town there was at least two cruise ships in the bay .
POSITIVE	The experience of going up the cable car is good and the reward is well worth it .
POSITIVE	This is also nice spot if you would bring something picnic food / drinks .
POSITIVE	Take a good shoes and lot of water and walk to the hill !
POSITIVE	To round of the experience do take the Cable Car to the top of the Hill ( or trainee mountain ) .
POSITIVE	Well worth queuing for , quick and easy to purchase tickets and board car .
POSITIVE	The cable car is a far superior way to take in the views in comfort .
POSITIVE	This trip exceeded expectations , from arriving at the top , most of the views on the designated platforms are very busy .
POSITIVE	There is beautiful sunset , you can start your journey back to down slowly little bit earlier when sun going down .
POSITIVE	Views amazing from the top , had a lovely meal at summit
POSITIVE	If you like watch whole sunset on the top , you definetily need flashlight when going back to down !
POSITIVE	Path is rocky and there is no nothing light on the way !
POSITIVE	Because of the cruise ship visitors daytime trips can also have a wait .
POSITIVE	The day and evening view are both terrific .
POSITIVE	You can take also amazing sunset pics on the way down .
POSITIVE	We were there early in the morning so only a short wait .
POSITIVE	We also stood near the front and side windows of the cable car for the best views whilst ascending .
POSITIVE	I have been to Dubrovnik several times and explored this lovely town however the view of a complete , walled , medieval town with red tiled roofs gave a totally different perspective .
POSITIVE	Instead , take a wander around the back of the visitor centre and past the tv mast and just keep walking .
POSITIVE	The views of the islands and the coastline set in a sparkling blue sea were stunning .
POSITIVE	You will find a lovely spot to enjoy the sunset and some fab photo ops !
POSITIVE	There is room to move around and take photographs with this unique backdrop .
POSITIVE	We followed it by a visit to a small seaside town of Cavtat which was well worth the short drive .
POSITIVE	A possible unspoilt resort for a short holiday .
POSITIVE	Cable car very clean with fab views .
POSITIVE	Amazing cable car very smooth ride .
POSITIVE	This was part of an excursion from our cruise ship .
POSITIVE	We were told that euros were accepted in most places .
POSITIVE	Excellent view at the top was reasonably priced
POSITIVE	Offers lovely view of the old city , the best time of the day is right before the sun goes down so that you can see both the morning view and the night view from the top of the city .
POSITIVE	Local currency is essential .
POSITIVE	Unfortunately that was not the case .
POSITIVE	Plus you can spend as much time as you need up there , such a cool breeze and restaurant & free toilets !
POSITIVE	For a fantastic view of the city and Lokrum take the cable car up .
POSITIVE	I recommend doing this while in Dubrovnik the views are amazing ! !
POSITIVE	Walk around to the old fort where ( for about 30 kuna ) you can see the museum dedicated to the 1991/92 war .
POSITIVE	It 's very new so looks lovely .
POSITIVE	You can either catch the cable car back down , or , if you have time ( and a good pair of walking shoes - not in flip flops ! ) take the zig-zag path back down the mountain admiring the changing views as you descend ( allow about an hour )
POSITIVE	It take only about 2 minutes to get on top so it 's very short ride and I think it take about 20 people , not too full so you still have some room to move .
POSITIVE	All I would say is buy tickets before you get to the cable car as we was able to skip most of the que as we already had tickets unlike others .
POSITIVE	A great insight to the history and background of the area .
POSITIVE	Time a trip up there cable car so you can enjoy a meal up top , overlooking the old city .
POSITIVE	The lighting is particularly nice very early or at sunset .
POSITIVE	It was a little cool at the top when we were there , due to breezy conditions .
POSITIVE	It is windy , so as the sun goes down , it gets chilly .
POSITIVE	On top is nice panorama restaurant with amazing view of old town , marina and fort , u must have a cup of coffee in there .
POSITIVE	Get there early to avoid the crowds , especially when the cruise ships arrive !
POSITIVE	Beautiful views on the way and at the top .
POSITIVE	Well worth to see it if you in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Ticket cost 60 kuna one way and 100 kuna return way .
POSITIVE	Views from there are amazing .
POSITIVE	Offers a really terrific view of the city and surroundings .
POSITIVE	My 5 year old loved the cable car and the view is spectacular .
POSITIVE	Great trip up mount srd .
POSITIVE	Loved the war museum at the top too .
POSITIVE	Not to be missed .
POSITIVE	We went as the sun was setting fabulous views of dubrovnik town and harbour and mountains ... not too expensive worth a trip up
POSITIVE	Once outside on the top , large terrace with bar / restaurant was a wonderful place to spend time .
POSITIVE	Great record of something that was not actually that long ago Pricey , but worth it
POSITIVE	absolute panoramic views of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The Old fort has an excellant portrayal of the 1991 war and the restaurant is great for lunch , dinner or just having a drink
POSITIVE	There is also a War Museum that you could miss if you do not take a walk down the steps and up the slight incline to your right .
POSITIVE	Whilst in Dubrovnik on 2 weeks holiday we did of course take a trip in the cable car from the old town area to the top .
POSITIVE	The Cable Car station is just a short walk from the Old Town walls .
POSITIVE	The views are fantastic , great photo opportunity .
POSITIVE	I was pleasantly surprised that there were no queues for the cable car .
POSITIVE	Had to wait in line for a few minutes but the view was definitely worth it .
POSITIVE	Go up an hour before sunset , view the sobering but enlightening museum , then go up on its battlements to see the sun set behind the islands .
POSITIVE	The view from the top was amazing , a great alternative view of Dubrovnik and the surrounding areas .
POSITIVE	Restaurant at the top serves lovely food and the views are to die for
POSITIVE	Yes it is expensive but you have the alternative to walk if you so wish .
POSITIVE	It 's very interesting and explains what happened if you do not know , like me ! !
POSITIVE	The Homeland War museum is a must visit when you are up on Mount Srdj .
POSITIVE	Just amazing .
POSITIVE	Fantastic views - took our own picnic having read other reviews - it was breezy up top but worth the wind for the views .
POSITIVE	The view was breathtaking and well worth the cost and waiting time .
POSITIVE	Took time out to explore and look at the photo of the war exhibition .
POSITIVE	Homeland War museum - he found it v interesting and spent over an hour in there - I enjoyed about 40 minutes or so and then retired to the sun with my book .
POSITIVE	We are staying in Old Town Dubrovnik and it took us about 15mins to walk to the start and ticket office .
POSITIVE	We did not use the restaurant so can not comment .
POSITIVE	It cost us 170kn each .
POSITIVE	The 150kunar fee for this cable car to bring you to the top of the mountain will sure to give you an unforgettable memory given 1 ) the view of the sunset on the sea and Dubrovnik old town with red-roofed houses . 2 ) the romantic moment and for dinner at Panorama view restaurant on the top at cable...
POSITIVE	We originally thought this was going to be an expensive family trip ...... However we all thoroughly enjoyed the short cable car journey and the views of Old Dubrovnik Town were stunning as the sun was setting !
POSITIVE	I accidentally left my water bottle in the Restaurant and they rang up from the bottom station and sent it down in the next cable car .
POSITIVE	There are some great photographic vantage point you can walk to once you are at the top .
POSITIVE	There is an outdoor and an indoor restaurant at the top with friendly staff .
POSITIVE	Along with city wall walking , this cable car is another do not miss experience for everyone to visit Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Sjd offers the best views in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The ride only takes a few minutes to reach the top .
POSITIVE	This 3 minute ride to the top of Mt .
POSITIVE	You can get a drink and also a meal there .
POSITIVE	From the top you can see 3 countries , have a nice meal ( al fresco or not ) , a drink and for just $5 USD more , visit the War Museum .
POSITIVE	There was no queue when we went up but when we came down the queues were up the road and long .
POSITIVE	The museum will bring to life the 1990s war that struck Dubrovnik hard .
POSITIVE	You can walk this without the cable car by climbing switchback trails or walk one way , ride one way .
POSITIVE	The Cocktails were delicious too on the roof terrace .
POSITIVE	We got there around 9:30 -9:45 am and stayed at the top for and hour or so .
POSITIVE	We rode both ways to save time and energy !
POSITIVE	A must if in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	We spent about 1 1/2 hours up there and then , waiting for the next lift down , stopped by the little cafe for a drink .
POSITIVE	If you buy a round trip ticket for the cable car , hold onto it - you must present it again for the return trip .
POSITIVE	The cable car is busy but the car can hold a lot of people so the queue moves quite fast .
POSITIVE	First I recommend checking out the local museum down in town with the special exhibit about the Dubrovnik Defenders to refresh your memory about the Serbian siege during the Yugoslavian war .
POSITIVE	Very interesting giving a lot of information and so wall set out .
POSITIVE	Then take the lift up to the top and walk up to the ruined fortress .
POSITIVE	The views are lovely .
POSITIVE	It is so worth the wait when you get to the top .
POSITIVE	We visited the war museum at the top .
POSITIVE	Very expensive -- I think something like the equiv . of 15-18 EUR for an Aperol Spritz -- but totally worth it , first for the stunning views , second for the charming waiter , and third because it was the best Spritz I have ever had ( and I have had plenty ) .
POSITIVE	Outstanding scenery and very nice restaurant .
POSITIVE	The cable car ride is great , but the highlight was having lunch at the top of the hill overlooking Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	A must do if you ’ re in their area , although it can get a bit windy up high .
POSITIVE	The settings and views from the restaurant are unbelievable as you view the City as well as the surrounding island the ocean .
POSITIVE	Well worth the cable car ride .
POSITIVE	Very recommended .
POSITIVE	While confronting ( and I did not spend long in some areas ) , the museum in the old fort was a real eye opener for us and filled in a lot of gaps in our knowledge of the most recent war .
POSITIVE	Great views of the whole of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The best way to get to the cable car is by bus , as finding the right set of very steep steps up to it can be difficult in the maze of the old town .
POSITIVE	It is well worth visiting the souvenir shop if you need unusual and inexpensive gifts for people at home .
POSITIVE	The views are beautiful and if you are fortunate like we were , you can have a great meal by the glass windows or outside - if good weather just looking out at the scenery .
POSITIVE	For £9 return you get a 5 minute trip up the mountain giving you amazing views of the old town and many of the islands around it .
POSITIVE	Great place to shoot pictures of the old town and city walls .
POSITIVE	Ride up takes 4 minutes in the cable car or 1:30 hrs approx if you take the trail up .
POSITIVE	Take the cable car at dusk and watch the sunset from the top it 's amazing and the views are stunning as far as the eye can see .
POSITIVE	We had a couple of beers and watched the world go by , before getting the return cable car .
POSITIVE	When you get to the top the views are uninterrupted and spectacular .
POSITIVE	Once back down finding your way into the old town is easy .
POSITIVE	Worth a trip .
POSITIVE	Take a camera .
POSITIVE	Can be very busy though .
POSITIVE	Wee bit of a walk for pile gate to get to it especially in the very hot day .
POSITIVE	Stunning views of the Old Town .
POSITIVE	Viewing platforms of whole city .
POSITIVE	Well worth doing !
POSITIVE	Great views of the whole city and a nice thing to do with kids .
POSITIVE	If you want a birds eye view of Dubrovnik and the Adriatic Sea beyond the Cable Car gives a fantastic view point from which to see the City .
POSITIVE	The ride up / down is pretty short so also suitable for those like me who are scared of heights .
POSITIVE	The views are amazing .
POSITIVE	A bit of queuing but it is August after all ! !
POSITIVE	Price a bit high but worth paying .
POSITIVE	Do not eat in the restaurant on the top - too expensive .
POSITIVE	Bring your own food and have picnic - plenty of benches available .
POSITIVE	Cars are safe .
POSITIVE	Wear flat shoes if your going to dinner afterwards its a bit rocky .
POSITIVE	we decided to take the cable car just before sunset . it was amazing even though it was very hazy from local forest fires . too bad but we enjoyed our time up there and toured the fort museum on top . after sundown , the lights of the city below was quite lovely .
POSITIVE	It 's a short walk behind the main building , there is a bit of a dirt road just follow round past a photography exhibit and find a spot .
POSITIVE	We witnessed the best sunset from the hill behind were the cable car takes you .
POSITIVE	Take a beverage in your bag , you will not be disappointed , it was well worth it
POSITIVE	Well worth the wait for the Cable Car and the short trip up to the top for the great views of The Old Town and the New Town .
POSITIVE	There is a nice walk and a cafe / restaurant so time could be spent there .
POSITIVE	This is a must visit place in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Ride is very safe and even if you are scared of heights . . this ride will not scare you .
POSITIVE	View at night is just spectacular .
POSITIVE	Cafe up there is good as well ...
POSITIVE	You see the old town from the top and the view is so much better than the city walls of Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	The cable cars were the best decision we made in Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Highly recommended !
POSITIVE	You get the most amazing views of the city doing this .
POSITIVE	... but can be big queues .
POSITIVE	Stunning view over the old Town .
POSITIVE	We wondered why tickets were sold in booths in town so we waited to buy them at the cable car , fearing being ripped off by roadside sellers .
POSITIVE	It was expensive - £20 for 1 adult and 1 child , but the views were truly worth it .
POSITIVE	If you arrive with a prepaid ticket , you by - pass the queue .
POSITIVE	Big mistake .
POSITIVE	The lines were long and the guided tour groups seemed to take priority .
POSITIVE	It is worth the money ; there is a day and night package for 160 Kuna per adult ( children up to 12 years for 50 Kuna up and down ) ; you can go up and down once during daytime and on the same day or another in the evening Till 24.00 .
POSITIVE	It 's a 3-minute ride each way , and you do not really need long at the top , unless you want to eat / drink at the pricey restaurant .
POSITIVE	We thought there were not many waiting but then a coach arrived , 30 people jumped the queue and ticket sales stopped .
POSITIVE	There are two viewing platforms that afford a 360 degree panorama of the surrounding area , looking over the Old Town and Lokrum on one side , out towards Lapad on another , Bosnia and Herzegovina on another and Montenegro on another .
POSITIVE	For the perfect aerial shot of the Old Town go up in the cable car to the top of Mount Srd . 130 kuna return gets you there .
POSITIVE	This happened a number of times so those in the queue were used as fillers if a cable car was not full .
POSITIVE	Busy times are when coach day trips arrive mid morning and sunset .
POSITIVE	The cable car runs regulary and it is just a short ride up to the top of the mountain .
POSITIVE	We went early in the morning and so we did not use the retaurant or cafe area .
POSITIVE	The views are stunning and it is worth going up .
POSITIVE	But great views when you get there .
POSITIVE	There is also a small shop .
POSITIVE	It does get crowded and some elbow their way to the front to take yet another picture of the same view with no consideration of others .
POSITIVE	There are toilets at the top and lifts to the various levels .
POSITIVE	You can pay a one way fare of 80 kuna and take the winding path down if you are well shod .
POSITIVE	If that happens to you can I suggest a short walk to Fort Srd .
POSITIVE	Climb to the top and you get the same view with nobody there !
POSITIVE	When you visit the fort you have to visit the museum .
POSITIVE	Definately worth a visit .

POSITIVE	Just to know why the museum and waving flag at the top of the mount Srd are so important for Dubrovnik .
POSITIVE	Yes it 's pricey , but the view of the old town is simply spectacular .
POSITIVE	do not miss this - the views are unbelievable - would be the perfect place to propose at the top of the mountian !
POSITIVE	A must see in Dubrovnik - the view is fabulous .
POSITIVE	Good facilities at the top too !
POSITIVE	You can walk the old city wall , you can view it by boat , but surely the most beautiful view is from the cable car ride to the top of the hill overlooking the city .
POSITIVE	It does not go if it is windy but we were able to keep our tickets and go when it was running .
POSITIVE	It is what it is , a short ride in a cable car , but the views from inside are unique and well worth the cost , as is sitting with a cocktail at the restaurant at the top watching the sun set .
POSITIVE	Dubrovnik , what a stunning city to visit .
POSITIVE	The view was absolutely awesome .
POSITIVE	Priceless experience .
POSITIVE	So pleased we did this .
POSITIVE	Well worth doing this .
POSITIVE	Easy to find , it is just outside the Old City .
POSITIVE	The uninterrupted views of the Old Town , Coastline and surrounding hills are breathtaking and being able to sit down for a drink or meal is a real bonus .
POSITIVE	There are only 2 cars but as they take approx 30 people each there was not a long wait in the queue .
POSITIVE	Even if you are a little weary of heights , the views will wipe those fears away .
POSITIVE	A trip in the cable car was including at the start of our cruise on one of the Katarina Line boats .
POSITIVE	The cable car costs 120kn for a return trip .

POSITIVE	It a quick and easy way to get to the top of the mountain .
POSITIVE	Panorama Restaurant is good .
POSITIVE	At the top there is a nice restaurant with prices for drink and food no different to the Old Town , I recommend visiting the fort museum which shows the story of the ' Homeland War ' 1991-1995 .
POSITIVE	Great view of the old town .
POSITIVE	The War Exhibition is worth a visit to see the t city 's modern history .
POSITIVE	The car itself is air conditioned which was welcomed !
POSITIVE	You will not be disappointed
POSITIVE	The Swiss-built cable car will bring you efficiently and comfortably to the top of the prominence above Dubrovnik in just 2 minutes .
POSITIVE	Make a reservation ( or be prepared to wait ) at the Panorama Restaurant to sit at a table by the edge of the cliff to admire the scenery while enjoying a fine meal ( we had a great Violetta salad ) .
POSITIVE	Imagine a cluster of terracotta rooves outlined by the creamy grey city walls set against the deep blue of the sea .
POSITIVE	Wonderful views of the old town and also inland should you venture to the other side of the viewing platform .
POSITIVE	It is not cheap , but the views from the top are truly breathtaking .
POSITIVE	You can enjoy a drink with a view which we enjoyed on a beautiful day .
POSITIVE	Over to the left is the emerald green island of Lokrum ( a nature reserve once cursed by Benedictine monks who were evicted from its shores and formerly home to the ill-fated Archduke Maximilian of Austria ) .
POSITIVE	At the top , bringing a sombre note to the experience , there is also a museum and memorial to those who fell in the war of the early 90s .
POSITIVE	For the energetic , there is a steep and winding path to walk back down to the town .

POSITIVE	We did it and then coupled it with the Buggy Safari .
POSITIVE	I highly recommend to see the beautiful sunset of the city from the top .
POSITIVE	It was such a nice day out expecially when the suns out .
POSITIVE	We took the easy option with the cable car .
POSITIVE	Make sure you do this and then you can get into the exhibition about the war .
POSITIVE	At first , I did not think that I wanted to spend the 150 HRK ( $30 CDN ) per person for a 3 minute cable car ride but I am glad that we did .
POSITIVE	The bonus is a fabulous restaurant at the top ( & a little gift shop ) that you can enjoy .
POSITIVE	It looked great - but we felt a little too sweaty and dusty from climbing the hill to try it .
POSITIVE	A nice , modern restaurant with fantastic panoramic views sits at the top .
POSITIVE	We walked up for the evening sunset , then got the cable car down .
POSITIVE	Great views !
POSITIVE	At the other extreme from the posh restaurant ; earthworks , trenches and shell damage from the 1990 's war are all evident on the part of the hill that has not been developed .
POSITIVE	Once on a solo mission to the war museum ( separate review ) and today with my wife to take in the sights and the buggy tour ( separate review ) .

POSITIVE	The lights against the dark sky is so worth the queue !
POSITIVE	Wait until just before sunset to take the cable car .
POSITIVE	This is a great way to see the complete panorama of Dubrovnik City an experience spoilt by an incredibly archaic ticket office .
POSITIVE	best to go early in the morning and late afternoon as it 's very crowded during the day with long queues .
